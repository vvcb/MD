	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Recent evidence suggests that the quantity of intra-abdominal fat may be a more important predictor of postoperative complications than body mass index ({BMI}). We hypothesized that increased intra-abdominal fat would be associated with longer operations, increased blood loss, more complications, and prolonged length of stay after pancreatic resection.
{METHODS}: Retrospective cohort study. Intra-abdominal fat was quantified using {CT} imaging, and patients were divided into three groups (low, moderate, high). Unconditional multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between obesity measures and complications.
{RESULTS}: Between 2002 and 2010, 255 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy, and 201 had preoperative {CT} imaging available for review. Operative time was significantly prolonged in patients with high quantities of intra-abdominal fat compared with those with low fat quantity (median 438 versus 354 min, P {\textless} 0.05), while {BMI} was not associated with changes in duration of surgery. Neither obesity defined by {BMI} ({OR} 0.90, 95\% {CI} 0.36-2.21) nor visceral fat ({OR} 1.20, 95\% {CI} 0.46-3.16) significantly predicted risk of complications. Median length of stay was similar in patients who were obese by {BMI} (7 versus 7.5 d) or amount of intra-abdominal fat (7 d).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Intra-abdominal fat was a better predictor than {BMI} for determining length of procedure. However, in contrast to previous studies evaluating abdominal surgery, neither {BMI} nor intra-abdominal fat significantly predicted risk of complication or length of hospital stay. Further research is needed to determine the best measure to assist in risk prediction of obese patients undergoing pancreatic surgery.},

Despite this, its assessment has yet to be adopted into routine clinical practice and the mechanisms underpinning  the relationships with cancer outcome are undetermined. {AIMS}: To examine the prognostic value of tumor necrosis in solid organ malignant disease and to summarize the known clinical, pathological and inflammatory associations. {METHODS}: A systematic review of data published from 1966-2011 was undertaken by two reviewers according to a predefined protocol. A total of 57 independent studies relating to renal (n = 23), breast (n = 13), lung (n = 7), colorectal (n  = 5) and other solid tumors (n = 9) were included in the final review. {CONCLUSION}: There is now a substantial body of evidence confirming the prognostic value of tumor necrosis in solid organ malignant disease. There are consistent associations between necrosis and the presence of other high-risk tumor characteristics but the survival impact appears to be independent of pathological stage. We propose that relationships with the host inflammatory response, both local and systemic, may explain the influence of tumor necrosis on cancer outcome.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate a novel tumor microenvironment-based prognostic score, based on histopathologic assessment of the tumor inflammatory cell infiltrate and tumor stroma, in patients with primary operable colorectal cancer. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: Using routine pathologic sections, the tumor inflammatory cell infiltrate and stroma were assessed using Klintrup-Makinen ({KM}) grade and tumor stroma percentage ({TSP}), respectively, in 307 patients who had undergone elective resection for stage I-{III} colorectal cancer. The clinical utility of a cumulative score based on these characteristics was examined. {RESULTS}: On univariate analysis, both weak {KM} grade and high {TSP} were associated with reduced survival ({HR}, 2.42; P = 0.001 and {HR}, 2.05; P = 0.001, respectively).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Postoperative complications such as anastomotic leakage were reported to be a major independent prognostic factor for long-term survival in gastrointestinal malignancies. This study sought to clarify the prognostic significance of postoperative inflammatory complications specifically for patients with gastric cancer.
{METHODS}: This study included 1,395 patients who underwent curative resection for gastric cancer from 2005 to 2008. Complications were evaluated according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Overall survival ({OS}) and disease-specific mortality ({DSM}) were compared between complication and no-complication groups. Presence of complications was modeled by the Cox proportional hazard model for {OS} and the Fine and Gray competing risk regression model for {DSM} to assess the correlation between complication and prognosis.
{RESULTS}: The median follow-up time was 3.1 years. Two hundred seven patients (14.8 \%) had complications of grade 2 or higher. Of 131 patients who died within this period, 87 died of gastric cancer. The 3-year {OS} in the complication group was 84.1 \% compared to 93.1 \% in the no-complication group (P {\textless} 0.0001). The cumulative incidence of {DSM} was also significantly worse in patients with complications (P {\textless} 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified the same significant increasing risk of complication for both {OS} (hazard ratio 1.88; 95 \% confidence interval 1.26-2.80) and {DSM} (hazard ratio 1.90; 95 \% confidence interval 1.19-3.02).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Postoperative complications that can cause prolonged inflammation have an obvious impact not only on the {OS} but also on the {DSM} of patients with gastric cancer even if the tumor is resected curatively.},

	issn = {1469-493X},
	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD005444.pub2},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Obstruction in the biliary drainage system causes a rise in serum bilirubin levels (obstructive jaundice). Studies have shown that surgery for severe obstructive jaundice is associated with high peri-operative mortality and morbidity. Jaundice has been considered as a potential risk factor for poor outcome, and pre-operative biliary drainage has been proposed as a method of reversing the pathophysiologic disturbance seen in patients with obstructive jaundice.
{OBJECTIVES}: To determine the benefits and harms of pre-operative biliary drainage (ie, endoscopic sphincterotomy with stent insertion or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage) in obstructive jaundice.
{SEARCH} {STRATEGY}: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register ({CHBG}), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials ({CENTRAL}) in The Cochrane Library, {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, the Chinese {BioMedical} Literature on disc ({CBM} disc), and the Chinese Medical Current Contents ({CMCC}). All databases were searched up to October 2006.
{SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: We considered for inclusion randomised clinical trials comparing biliary drainage followed by surgery and direct surgery performed for obstructive jaundice.
{DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: We collected the available data on the characteristics of the trial, methodological quality of the trials, mortality, morbidity, and hospital stay as reported in each trial. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models, using {RevMan} Analysis. For each outcome, we calculated the odds ratio ({OR}) with 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) based on intention-to-treat analysis.
{MAIN} {RESULTS}: Five trials with 320 patients (160 in each group) were included. Four trials (n = 235) compared percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage with direct surgery, and one trial (n = 85) compared pre-operative endoscopic drainage with direct surgery. All trials were of low methodological quality. There was no significant difference in mortality ({OR} 1.14, 95\% {CI} 0.60 to 2.10) between the pre-operative biliary drainage group and the direct surgery group. No significant difference was found in mortality ({OR} 1.16, 95\% {CI} 0.56 to 2.41), overall morbidity ({OR} 1.35, 95\%{CI} 0.48 to 3.83), and in different complications between the percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage group and the direct surgery group. The trial comparing pre-operative endoscopic drainage and direct surgery showed no significant difference in mortality ({OR} 1.09, 95\% {CI} 0.32 to 3.68), but found higher morbidity in the endoscopic drainage group. The overall hospital stay was 8 to 17 days shorter in the direct surgery group.
{AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: Our analyses neither supports nor refutes pre-operative biliary drainage for patients with obstructive jaundice needing surgery. In some specific lesion site it may cause more complications. Pre-operative biliary drainage also prolonged hospital stay and increased cost. However, the strength of evidence is low because of the poor quality of the included trials. More rigorously designed randomised clinical trials with larger sample size and advanced techniques and drugs are needed.},

	abstract = {To elucidate the pathogenesis of renal dysfunction associated with obstructive jaundice, body water compartments were measured using a multi-isotope dilution technique in ten patients with biliary tract obstruction and in ten control subjects matched for age, sex, weight, height and body surface area. Expressed as a fraction of body-weight, total body water was reduced in jaundiced patients (41.8 versus 46.2 per cent, P less than 0.02). Extracellular water volume was also reduced in patients with jaundice (20.3 versus 24.3 per cent, P less than 0.003) owing to a reduction of the interstitial space (16.1 versus 19.5 per cent, P less than 0.004) and, to a lesser degree, of the plasma volume (4.2 versus 4.8 per cent, P = 0.1). There was a close correlation in jaundiced patients between plasma volume and the creatinine clearance rate (r2 = 0.56, P less than 0.02) and between plasma volume and extracellular volume (r2 = 0.77, P less than 0.0001). Extracellular volume in such patients also correlated with the percentage weight loss (r2 = 0.42, P = 0.04). Obstructive jaundice is associated with a contracted extracellular water compartment, although extracellular water, as a percentage of body-weight, increased in proportion to the body-weight lost. Reduction of the interstitial volume and a marginally reduced plasma volume may be determinant factors in the pathogenesis of the renal and haemodynamic disturbances observed in patients with biliary tract obstruction.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}: The present review summarizes key studies on the effects of major abdominal surgery on the host response to infection published during the last 18 months.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Surgical trauma causes stereotyped systemic proinflammatory and compensatory anti-inflammatory reactions. It is leukocyte reprogramming rather than general immune suppression. The list of recent findings is long. Preoperative infectious challenge was found to increase survival. Obesity is associated with increased production of interleukin-17A in peritonitis. Abdominal surgery alters expression of toll-like receptors ({TLRs}). The acute phase reaction down-regulates the transcription factor carbohydrate response element binding protein. Myosin light chain kinase activation is a final pathway of acute tight junction regulation of gut barrier and zonula occludens 1 protein is an essential effector. The brain is involved in regulating the immune and gut system. Elimination of lipopolysaccharide is challenging. Th1/Th2 ratio is lowered in patients with postoperative complications. Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways can inhibit tissue damage. The new substance {PXL}01 prevents adhesions. Postoperative infection causes incisional hernias. Hypothermia reduced human leukocyte antigen {DR} surface expression and delayed tumor necrosis factor clearance. Systems biology identified interferon regulatory factor 3 as the negative regulator of {TLR} signaling. Protective immunity could contribute defeating surgical infections.
{SUMMARY}: Systemic inflammation is the usual response to trauma. All organs seem to be involved and linked up in cybernetic systems aiming at reconstitution of homeostasis. Although knowledge is still fragmentary, it is already difficult to integrate known facts and new technologies are required for information processing. Defining criteria to develop therapeutic strategies requires much more insight into molecular mechanisms and cybernetics of organ systems.},

The post-operative mortality in nonspecialist centres often exceeds 20\% but is around 6\% or less in specialist centres. The overall complication rate even in specialist centres is 18-54\%. An analysis of eleven large series of pancreatic resections shows an incidence of common complications of 10.4\% for fistula, 9.9\% for delayed gastric emptying, 4.8\% for bleeding, 4.8\% for wound infection and 3.8\% for intra-abdominal abscess. The median hospital stay is 13-18 days in different series. The re-operation rate varies from 4 to 9\% with a mortality rate of 23 to 67\%. Major complications are a significant factor in post-operative mortality, especially if they require re-operation. The use of octreotide or somatostatin to prevent complications is supported by several multicentre, double-blind, randomized controlled trials.

	abstract = {Our current understanding of sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction needs to be revised, as the uniformly negative results of new therapies for these disorders suggest.Previous theories for the pathogenesis of these conditions are incomplete; reasons for this include the following. First, the surrogate models that have been used to study these disorders are not analogous to the clinical situation. Second, patients who have less severe manifestations of these diseases are often overlooked. And third, patients' preexisting conditions have not been taken into account. Considerable new evidence indicates that, in addition to a massive proinflammatory reaction, a compensatory anti-inflammatory response contributes to the onset of these disorders. At a local site of injury or infection and during the initial appearance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in the circulation, the beneficial effects of these mediators outweigh their harmful effects. Only when the balance between these two forces is lost do these mediators become harmful. Sequelae of an unbalanced systemic proinflammatory reaction include shock, transudation into organs, and defects in coagulation. An unbalanced systemic compensatory anti-inflammatory response can result in anergy and immunosuppression. The proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory forces may ultimately reinforce each other, creating a state of increasingly destructive immunologic dissonance.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To examine the relationship between preoperative biliary drainage and the morbidity and mortality associated with pancreaticoduodenectomy. {SUMMARY} {BACKGROUND} {DATA}: Recent reports have suggested that preoperative biliary drainage increases the perioperative morbidity and mortality rates of pancreaticoduodenectomy. {METHODS}: Peri-operative morbidity and mortality were evaluated in 300 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done to evaluate the relationship between preoperative biliary decompression and the following end points: any complication, any major complication, infectious complications, intraabdominal abscess, pancreaticojejunal anastomotic leak, wound infection, and postoperative death. {RESULTS}: Preoperative prosthetic biliary drainage was performed in 172 patients (57\%) (stent group), 35 patients (12\%) underwent surgical biliary bypass performed during prereferral laparotomy, and the remaining 93 patients (31\%) (no-stent group) did not undergo any form of preoperative biliary decompression. The overall surgical death rate was 1\% (four patients); the number of deaths was too small for multivariate analysis. By multivariate logistic regression, no differences were found between the stent and no-stent groups in the incidence of all complications, major complications, infectious complications, intraabdominal abscess, or pancreaticojejunal anastomotic leak. Wound infections were more common in the stent group than the no-stent group. {CONCLUSIONS}: Preoperative biliary decompression increases the risk for postoperative wound infections after pancreaticoduodenectomy. However, there was no increase in the risk of major postoperative complications or death associated with preoperative stent placement. Patients with extrahepatic biliary obstruction do not necessarily require immediate laparotomy to undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates; such patients can be treated by endoscopic biliary drainage without concern for increased major complications and death associated with subsequent pancreaticoduodenectomy.},

	abstract = {Unconjugated bilirubin ({UCB}), the principal mammalian bile pigment, is the end product of heme catabolism. Both belong to the superfamily of tetrapyrrolic compounds that serve multiple biological functions in animals and plants. Its six internal hydrogen bonds give {UCB} a unique structure responsible for its physico-chemical properties and biological effects. Like many weakly-polar, poorly-soluble compounds, {UCB} is transported in blood tightly bound to albumin, with less than 0.01\% of total bilirubin circulating in an unbound form (free bilirubin, Bf). This fraction governs the diffusion of {UCB} into tissues, and therefore Bf is responsible for both its beneficial and toxic effects on cells. Although, {UCB} was long thought to be a non-functional waste product, recent studies have shown that the antioxidant effects of mildly elevated serum bilirubin levels, as well as activation of heme oxygenase, may protect against diseases associated with oxidative stress, such as atherosclerosis. By contrast, markedly elevated serum {UCB} levels may cause severe neurological damage, especially in neonates. The regulation of cellular {UCB} content, by its conjugation, oxidation, and export, are, therefore of paramount importance to cellular health.},

	abstract = {Purpose
This review evaluates the current and future role of cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) in the context of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ({ERAS}) programs.

Principal findings
There is substantial literature confirming the relationship between physical fitness and perioperative outcome in general. The few small studies in patients undergoing surgery within an {ERAS} program describe less fit individuals having a greater incidence of morbidity and mortality. There is evidence of increasing adoption of perioperative {CPET}, particularly in the {UK}. Although {CPET}-derived variables have been used to guide clinical decisions about choice of surgical procedure and level of perioperative care as well as to screen for uncommon comorbidities, the ability of {CPET}-derived variables to guide therapy and thereby improve outcome remains uncertain. Recent studies have reported a reduction in {CPET}-defined physical fitness following neoadjuvant therapies (chemo- and radio-therapy) prior to surgery. Preliminary data suggest that this effect may be associated with an adverse effect on clinical outcomes in less fit patients. Early reports suggest that {CPET}-derived variables can be used to guide the prescription of exercise training interventions and thereby improve physical fitness in patients prior to surgery (i.e., prehabilitation). The impact of such interventions on clinical outcomes remains uncertain.

Conclusions
Perioperative {CPET} is finding an increasing spectrum of roles, including risk evaluation, collaborative decision-making, personalized care, monitoring interventions, and guiding prescription of prehabilitation. These indications are potentially of importance to patients having surgery within an {ERAS} program, but there are currently few publications specific to {CPET} in the context of {ERAS} programs.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: No effective medical therapy exists for early abdominal aortic aneurysm ({AAA}) disease. Lower extremity exercise improves aortic hemodynamics and reduces inflammation, but the safety and efficacy of exercise training in {AAA} disease is unknown. As an interim analysis of our prospective, randomized, longitudinal trial of exercise for {AAA} suppression, we investigated whether subjects with early disease could safely achieve target metabolic and hemodynamic goals.
{METHODS}: One hundred eight participants were randomized to exercise training ({EX}) or usual care ({UC}). {EX} subjects participated in a combination of in-house and home exercise training, with efforts directed toward moderate daily exercise participation. Comparisons were made between {EX} and {UC} subjects who completed 1 year of follow-up (n = 26 and 31, respectively, mean age 72 ± 8 years). {EX} and {UC} groups were compared for safety, cardiopulmonary exercise test responses, weekly energy expenditure, and biometric indices.
{RESULTS}: No paradoxical increase in {AAA} growth rate or adverse clinical events occurred as a consequence of exercise training. {EX} participants expended an average of 2269 ± 1207 kcal/wk and increased exercise capacity (42\% increase in treadmill time, 24\% increase in estimated metabolic equivalents, P = .01 and .08 between groups, respectively). {EX} participants demonstrated a significant reduction in C-reactive protein and tended to reduce waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (P = .06 and .07, respectively).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Preliminary analyses suggest that exercise training is well tolerated and sustainable in small {AAA} subjects over 1 year. Despite age and comorbidities, exercising {AAA} subjects achieve meaningful exercise targets and significantly modify activity-dependent variables.},

Thirty-day outcome data were collected for each patient. {RESULTS}: Overall mortality in the group was 10\%. No patient who walked 350 m or more died within 30 days. Five of the eight patients who could not achieve this distance died and two others remained in the critical care unit at 30 days. {CONCLUSION}: Preoperative shuttle walk testing using a standard protocol appears to be a sensitive indicator of operative risk in this group of patients. The apparent threshold value of 350 m is consistent with previously reported measures of functional capacity obtained using formal {CPX} testing.},

	abstract = {Pancreatoduodenectomy is the only potentially curative treatment for peripapillary tumors. However, postoperative mortality remains as high as 5\% and as many as 50\% of patients have postoperative morbidity. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and placement of a biliary drainage stent aim to achieve a precise diagnosis, reduce jaundice and improve the results of surgery for biliary malignancies, but the effectiveness of preoperative biliary drainage in the prevention of postoperative infections is controversial. A retrospective analysis was performed in a series of 58 patients with periampullary tumors who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy and the relationship between preoperative biliary drainage and postoperative complications was examined. Biliary drainage (25.8\%) before pancreatoduodenectomy was significantly associated with more frequent biliary and pancreatic anastomotic leakage (60\% with drainage versus 20.9\% without drainage), higher postoperative morbidity, and greater mean postoperative length of hospital stay (33.3 days with drainage versus 21.6 without drainage). No significant difference was found between the two groups in postoperative mortality at 30 days (13.7\%). The effectiveness of biliary drainage before surgery in patients with pancreatic and peripancreatic lesions has not been well established, but we believe that this procedure should be avoided whenever possible in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic and peripancreatic lesions. Prospective randomized studies are required to clarify the indications for preoperative biliary drainage in these patients.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: In patients with large abdominal aortic aneurysm ({AAA}), open surgical or endovascular aneurysm repair procedures are often used to minimise the risk of aneurysm-related rupture and death; however, aneurysm repair itself carries a high risk. Low cardiopulmonary fitness is associated with an increased risk of early post-operative complications and death following elective {AAA} repair. Therefore, fitness should be enhanced before aneurysm repair. High-intensity interval exercise training ({HIT}) is a potent, time-efficient strategy for enhancing cardiopulmonary fitness. Here, we describe a feasibility study for a definitive trial of a pre-operative {HIT} intervention to improve post-operative outcomes in patients undergoing elective {AAA} repair.
{METHODS} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: A minimum of 50 patients awaiting elective repair of a 5.5-7.0 cm infrarenal {AAA} will be allocated by minimisation to {HIT} or usual care control in a 1:1 ratio. The patients allocated to {HIT} will complete three hospital-based exercise sessions per week, for 4 weeks. Each session will include 2 or 4 min of high-intensity stationary cycling followed by the same duration of easy cycling or passive recovery, repeated until a total of 16 min of high-intensity exercise is accumulated. Outcomes to be assessed before randomisation and 24-48 h before aneurysm repair include cardiopulmonary fitness, maximum {AAA} diameter and health-related quality of life. In the post-operative period, we will record destination (ward or critical care unit), organ-specific morbidity, mortality and the durations of critical care and hospital stay. Twelve weeks after the discharge, participants will be interviewed to reassess quality of life and determine post-discharge healthcare utilisation. The costs associated with the exercise intervention and healthcare utilisation will be calculated.
{ETHICS} {AND} {DISSEMINATION}: Ethics approval was secured through Sunderland Research Ethics Committee. The findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, and national and international presentations.

The mortality rates were 25\% in males and 10\% in females (P = 0.043) after minor surgery, 26\% in males and 23\% in females (P = {NS}) after intermediate surgery, and 44\% in males and 39\% in females (P = {NS}) after major surgery. On univariate logistic regression analysis in males, increasing age (P {\textless} 0.001), severity of surgery (P = 0.04), and seniority of anesthetist (P {\textless} 0.001) were associated with mortality. In females, severity of surgery (P {\textless} 0.001) was associated with mortality. {CONCLUSIONS}: These results show that in females, 30-day mortality was determined by severity of surgery, whereas in males increasing age and seniority of anesthetist also influenced},

We use cardiopulmonary exercise testing to establish the anaerobic threshold as the sole measure of cardiopulmonary function as well as to detect myocardial ischemia. Patients with an anaerobic threshold {\textless} 11 ml/min/kg are at risk for major surgery, and perioperative management must be planned accordingly. Myocardial ischemia combined with moderate to severe cardiac failure (anaerobic threshold {\textless} 11 ml/min/kg) is predictive of the highest morbidity and mortality.},

	abstract = {Bilirubin for decades was considered a potentially toxic waste product of heme degradation until the discovery that it is a potent antioxidant. Accumulating data from observations in humans and experimental studies indicate that the bile pigment may be protective against certain diseases. Based on our own observations that bilirubin induces cell cycle arrest in abnormally proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells and clinical observations describing a lesser incidence of cancer in healthy individuals with high normal or slightly elevated serum bilirubin levels, we hypothesized that bilirubin might suppress tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. As possible effectors we analyzed key proteins that are involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. In vivo, tumor growth was assessed in {BALB}/c nude mice bearing {HRT}-18 colon cancer xenografts that were treated with bilirubin. In vitro, we investigated the effect of bilirubin on various cell lines and the signaling pathways involved in bilirubin action on tumor cell proliferation in {HRT}-18 cells using western blots. Bilirubin potently inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vivo and acted cytostatic and pro-apoptotic in vitro. The signaling cascades responsible for this action involved induction of p53, p27, hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein as well as caspase activation. These effects were dependent on {ERK} 1/2. Our study demonstrates that bilirubin may play a role in the defense against cancer by interfering with pro-cancerogenic signaling pathways.},

The incidence of {POPF} varies greatly in different reports, depending on the definition applied at each surgical center. Our aim was to agree upon an objective and internationally accepted definition to allow comparison of different surgical experiences. {METHODS}: An international panel of pancreatic surgeons, working in well-known, high-volume centers, reviewed the literature on the topic and worked together to develop a simple, objective, reliable, and easy-to-apply definition of {POPF}, graded primarily on clinical impact. {RESULTS}: A {POPF} represents a failure of healing/sealing of a pancreatic-enteric anastomosis or a parenchymal leak not directly related to an anastomosis. An all-inclusive definition is a drain output of any measurable volume of fluid on or after postoperative day 3 with an amylase content greater than 3 times the serum amylase activity. Three different grades of {POPF} (grades A, B, C) are defined according to the clinical impact on the patient's hospital course. {CONCLUSIONS}: The present definition and clinical grading of {POPF} should allow realistic comparisons of surgical experiences in the future when new techniques, new operations, or new pharmacologic agents that may impact surgical treatment of pancreatic disorders are addressed.},

Potentially curative surgical resections of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were performed on 103 patients. Survival was analyzed according to various clinicopathologic variables.
{RESULTS}: Negative surgical margins (p = 0.0075) and absence of postoperative major complications related to surgery (p = 0.0116) were all significantly favorable prognostic factors in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Margin-negative pancreatectomy without major complications showed the most favorable oncologic outcomes in resected pancreatic cancer (median survival, 35.6 months; 95\% confidential interval, 25.8-45.4 months), while major morbidities diminished survival benefit of R0 resection [R0-Cx(+), Exp(beta) = 1.925, p = 0.034, and R1, Exp(beta) = 3.129, p = 0.001].

	abstract = {We evaluated the relationship of body composition, maximal aerobic capacity ({VO}2max), and muscle strength to bone mineral density in 91 healthy men and women, age 61–84 years. Lean body mass was estimated from two independent measures of fat mass, bioelectrical impedance and skinfold thickness. {VO}2max was determined by treadmill ergometry with direct measurement of oxygen consumption. Grip and back strength were measured by isometric dynamometry. Mineral density of lumbar spine and midradius were measured by dual- and single-photon absorptiometry. Men had significantly greater lean mass, muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and bone density than women. In women, grip strength correlated with forearm and spine density (r = 0.37, r = 0.28, p {\textless} 0.05). In men, grip strength correlated with forearm density (r = 0.47, p {\textless} 0.05), and back strength was significantly correlated with both spine (r = 0.46, p {\textless} 0.01) and forearm density (r = 0.46, p {\textless} 0.01). In women, neither forearm nor spine density correlated significantly with aerobic capacity. In men, midradius density did not correlate significantly with oxygen consumption, but the simple correlation between spine density and {VO}2max was significant (r = 0.41, p {\textless} 0.05). Back strength and {VO}2max were significantly related in men (r = 0.47, p {\textless} 0.01). By stepwise multiple regression, back strength emerged as the most robust predictor of spine mineral, accounting for 19\% of the variation in bone density. Addition of {VO}2max to the regression did not add significant predictive value. However, when {VO}2max was expressed per kilogram lean body mass, both back strength and {VO}2max contributed significantly to the prediction of spine density in men, and the coefficient of determination R2 increased to 0.30. We conclude that body mass and grip strength, but not aerobic capacity, significantly predict bone density in elderly women. In elderly men, back strength is a more robust predictor of axial bone density than traditional expressions of aerobic capacity, but {VO}2max per kilogram lean mass and back strength both make significant contributions to the prediction of spine mineral density. The applicability of these results to younger men and women is uncertain.},

The postoperative mortality rate after Whipple's operation was 8\% (eight patients). The median survival period was 1.1 year and the overall five year survival rate was 15\% (confidence limits, 5 to 25\%).

The median survival rate in patients with adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater was 3.3 years, which was significantly longer than in the other patients. Fifty-nine patients with distant spread could be divided into 14 patients with para-aortic lymph node metastases who had a significantly shorter survival period than 45 patients without para-aortic lymph node metastases (p = 0.004). Resection of periampullary carcinoma provides a better palliation and survival rate than nonoperative biliary drainage or bypass operation.

This study was undertaken to compare the survival of patients with biliary obstruction caused by unresectable pancreatic head cancer after surgical and non-surgical palliation. {METHODS}: We retrospectively reviewed 69 patients who underwent palliative treatment for unresectable pancreatic head cancer. Fifty-two patients with locally advanced disease (local vascular invasion) and 17 with distant metastatic disease were included. The patients were divided into two groups, surgical and non-surgical palliation. {RESULTS}: Thirty-eight patients underwent biliary bypass surgery and 31 had percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage ({PTBD}). There was no significant difference in the early complications, successful biliary drainage, recurrent jaundice, and 30-day mortality between surgical palliation and {PTBD}. However, in 52 patients whose tumor was unresectable secondary to local vascular invasion, the rate of recurrent jaundice after successful surgical biliary palliation was lower than that in patients who had non-surgical palliation (P{\textless}0.05). The patients who underwent surgical palliation had a longer hospital-free survival rate (P{\textless}0.001), although they had a longer postoperative hospital stay (P=0.004) during the first admission period. {CONCLUSIONS}: In patients with preoperative evaluations showing potentially resectable tumors and/or no metastatic lesions, surgical exploration should be performed. Thus, in patients who have unresectable cancer or limited metastatic disease on exploration, surgical palliation should be performed for longer survival and better quality of survival.},

However, it is not yet established if any specific component of systemic inflammatory response is a better predictor of cancer survival. The aim of the present study was to compare the predictive value of selected markers of systemic inflammation  in patients who undergo surgical resection of oesophageal cancer. {METHODS}: One hundred twelve patients who underwent potentially curative resection for oesophageal carcinoma, including type I and type {II} tumours of the gastro-oesophageal junction (Siewert and Stein in Dis Esophagus 9:173-182, 1996), between 1996 and 2008 were included in the study. Patients had laboratory measurement of white cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelet counts, albumin, and C-reactive protein. Glasgow Prognostic Score ({mGPS}), neutrophil lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}), platelet lymphocyte ratio ({PLR}), and metastatic lymph node ratio ({LNR}) were calculated. {RESULTS}: On multivariate analysis, only the {LNR} ({HR} 2.87,  95\% {CI} 1.99-4.15, p {\textless} 0.001) and the {mGPS} ({HR} 4.31, 95\% {CI} 2.20-8.45, p {\textless} 0.001)  were independently associated with cancer-specific survival in oesophageal cancer. An elevated {mGPS} was associated with high white cell count (p {\textless} 0.05) and poorer survival (p = 0.001). {CONCLUSION}: The present study indicates that the {mGPS}, an acute-phase protein-based prognostic score, better predicts cancer survival compared with the cellular components of systemic inflammation in patients with oesophageal carcinoma.},

In particular, it has been consistently reported that both the local and systemic inflammatory responses play an important role in determining outcome in colorectal cancer. Given the importance of cancer-associated inflammation, up-regulation or attenuation of these respective inflammatory responses may be important for progression and survival in colorectal cancer. Recent work has focused on the inter-relationships between the tumour and these key inflammatory processes. In particular, tumour necrosis has been reported to be associated with decreased local inflammatory infiltrate and with elevated markers of systemic inflammation in colorectal cancer and has been proposed as a potential link between the systemic and local inflammatory responses.

However, the basis of this reduction is not known. Vitamin antioxidant concentrations have been reported to be correlated with a systemic inflammatory response (as evidenced by C-reactive protein) in normal subjects and in patients with lung cancer. In order to determine whether this relationship was independent of tumour type patients other common solid tumours were studied. {METHODS}: Fasting circulating concentrations of vitamin antioxidants and C-reactive protein were measured in normal subjects (n=30) and patients with breast (n=15), prostate (n=15) and colorectal cancer (n=11). {RESULTS}: Concentrations of C-reactive protein were higher (P{\textless}0.0001) and vitamin  antioxidants lower (P{\textless}0.0001) in the cancer patients. In normal subjects and cancer patients, C-reactive protein concentrations were inversely correlated with circulating concentrations of retinol (r(2)=0.162), alpha-tocopherol (r(2)=0.297), lutein (r(2)=0.256), lycopene (r(2)=-0.171), alpha-(r(2)=0.140) and beta-carotene (r(2)=0.254): (all P{\textless}0.001). {CONCLUSIONS}: Concentrations of retinol, alpha -tocopherol and carotenoids are inversely associated with the magnitude of the systemic inflammatory response.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) provides an objective assessment of functional capacity. The aim of this study was to assess whether preoperative {CPET} identifies patients at risk of early death following elective open and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm ({AAA}) repair.
{METHODS}: Prospective data were collected from a pilot study between September 2005 and February 2007, and from all patients who underwent {CPET} before elective {AAA} repair at two vascular centres between February 2007 and November 2011. Symptom-limited, maximal {CPET} was performed on each patient. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to identify risk factors for 30- and 90-day mortality.
{RESULTS}: Some 415 patients underwent {CPET} before elective {AAA} repair. Anaerobic threshold ({AT}), peak oxygen consumption (peak V.O(2) ) and ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide were associated with 30- and 90-day mortality on univariable analysis. On multivariable analysis, open repair (odds ratio ({OR}) 4·92, 95 per cent confidence interval 1·55 to 17·00; P = 0·008), {AT} below 10·2 ml per kg per min ({OR} 6·35, 1·84 to 29·80; P = 0·007), anaemia ({OR} 3·27, 1·04 to 10·50; P = 0·041) and inducible cardiac ischaemia ({OR} 6·16, 1·48 to 23·07; P = 0·008) were associated with 30-day mortality. Anaemia, inducible cardiac ischaemia and peak V.O(2) less than 15 ml per kg per min ({OR} 8·59, 2·33 to 55·75; P = 0·005) were associated with 90-day mortality on multivariable analysis. Patients with two or more subthreshold {CPET} values were at increased risk of both 30- and 90-day mortality.

	abstract = {Anemia is frequent in chronic heart failure ({HF}). To calculate what change in peak oxygen uptake ( {VO}(2)) should be expected in the event of changes in hemoglobin concentration, we studied the correlation between peak {VO}(2) and hemoglobin concentration in a large {HF} population. We carried out retrospective analysis of all cardiopulmonary exercise tests ({CPET}) performed in our {HF} Clinic between June 2001 and March 2009 in {HF} patients who had a resting hemoglobin concentration measurement taken within 7 days of the {CPET}. We collected 967 {CPETs}, 704 tests were considered maximal and analyzed. We identified 181 patients (26\%) as anemic. Peak {VO}(2) was lower (P {\textless} 0.001) in anemic patients (971 +/- 23 ml/min) compared with nonanemic (1243 +/- 18 ml/min). The slope of the {VO}(2) vs. hemoglobin ratio was 109 ml/min/g/dl at peak exercise. This correlation remained significant also when several confounding variables were analyzed by multivariate analysis. As an average, each gram of hemoglobin accounts, at peak exercise, for 109 ml/min change in {VO}(2) which is equivalent to 0.97 ml/min/kg. Therefore, in {HF} patients anemia treatment should increase {VO}(2) by 109 ml/min for each g/dl of hemoglobin increase.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: We evaluated the usefulness of analyzing expired gas during exercise testing for the prediction of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications in patients with esophageal carcinoma. {BACKGROUND} {DATA}: Radical esophagectomy with 3-field lymphadenectomy is performed in patients with thoracic esophageal carcinoma but has a high risk of postoperative complications. To reduce the surgical risk, we performed preoperative risk analysis using 8 factors. Although hospital mortality was decreased when this risk analysis was used, severe cardiopulmonary complications still occurred. {METHODS}: The study group consisted of 91 patients who had undergone curative esophagectomy with 3-field lymphadenectomy. The maximum oxygen uptake, anaerobic threshold, vital capacity, percent vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, percent forced expiratory volume, V.(25)/{HT}, forced expired flow at 75\% of forced vital capacity to height ratio ({FEF}(75\%)/{HT}), forced expired flow at 50\% to 75\% of forced vital capacity ratio ({FEF}(50\%)/{FEF}(75\%)), percent diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, and arterial oxygen tension were measured. Patients were divided into 2 groups on the basis of the presence or absence of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications. {RESULTS}: Only the maximum oxygen uptake was significantly different between the 2 groups. All patients were grouped according to the value of the maximum oxygen uptake, and the occurrence of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications was calculated for each group. A cardiopulmonary complication rate of 86\% was found for patients with a maximum oxygen uptake of less than 699 {mL}. min(-1). m(-2); for those with a value of 700 to 799 {mL}. min(-1). m(-2), the complication rate was 44\%. {CONCLUSIONS}: The maximum oxygen uptake obtained by expired gas analysis during exercise testing correlates with the postoperative cardiopulmonary complication rate. On the basis of these results, esophagectomy with 3-field lymphadenectomy can be safely performed in patients with a maximum oxygen uptake of at least 800 {mL}. min(-1). m(-2).},

This study evaluated preoperative biliary drainage in relation to postoperative outcomes. {STUDY} {DESIGN}: At the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, a cohort of 311 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy from June 1992 up to and including December 1999 was studied. Of this cohort 21 patients with external or surgical biliary drainage were excluded and 232 patients who had received preoperative internal biliary drainage were divided into three groups corresponding with severity of jaundice according to preoperative plasma bilirubin levels: {\textless} 40 {microM} (n = 177), 40 to 100 {microM} (n = 32), and {\textgreater} 100 {microM} (n = 23) were designated as groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Although patients in group 1 were better drained than patients in groups 2 and 3 (median reduction of bilirubin levels 82\%, 57\%, and 37\%, respectively, p {\textless} 0.01), there was no difference in overall morbidity among the drained groups (50\%, 50\%, and 52\%, respectively).

An infection surveillance program finalized to minimize the incidence of postoperative infections through the respect of available techniques leads to a better quality of work in each surgical unit, to a decrease in postoperative hospital stay and to cost reduction.},

	url = {http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3180897},
	abstract = {Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) usually have limited exercise tolerance owing to low ventilatory capacity. Because metabolic acidosis induced by exercise increases ventilatory drive, decreasing the hydrogen ion stimulus may improve exercise capacity. However, in those with mechanical limitation to ventilation or chemoreceptor insensitivity, identifying metabolic acidosis may be difficult using gas exchange methods that depend on the ventilatory response to the acidosis. We compared a modification of a gas exchange method (V-slope) for determining the lactate (anaerobic) threshold ({AT}), which is independent of ventilatory response with a method using the change in blood standard bicarbonate ({HCO}3-) level in {COPD} and normal subjects during cycle incremental exercise. In 43 normal subjects, the {VO}2 at which metabolic acidosis was identified using the two method correlated (r = 0.75), although mean values differed. In 22 patients with moderately severe to severe {COPD}, eight who had a change in standard {HCO}3- less than 2.0 {mEq}/L between rest and 2 min of recovery from exercise (group 1) were contrasted with 14 whose blood standard {HCO}3- fell by greater than 2.5 {mEq}/L (group 2). Mean {VC} was higher and {FEV}1/{VC} was lower in group 2, but mean {FEV}1, maximal voluntary ventilation, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide were not different. The degree of obstruction did not correlate strongly with the degree of exercise metabolic acidosis. The {AT} determined by the V-slope method was compared with that from standard {HCO}3-; good correlation between these methods was found (r = 0.98), although mean values were different. The V-slope method predicted metabolic acidosis in 10/14 who had a fall in {HCO}3- more than 2.5 {mEq}/L. A significant proportion of patients with {COPD} seem to develop metabolic acidosis during exercise. The V-slope gas exchange method may be useful in selecting those patients with {COPD} who develop exercise metabolic acidosis and might therefore benefit from exercise training.},

There is increasing evidence that additional patient-related prognostic factors, such as ongoing systemic inflammatory response, are associated with poor outcomes in patients with common solid tumors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of the modified glasgow prognostic score ({mGPS}) in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Methods Data were collected from 101 patients who had undergone pancreatic resection for ductal adenocarcinoma. Tumor and host factors were analyzed by Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate their potential prognostic effects. Results An elevated {mGPS} was associated with lower overall survival rate after pancreatic resection. The median actuarial survival rate for patients with an {mGPS} of 0, 1, or 2 was 37.2, 11.5, and 7.3, respectively (p = 0.0001). The Cox proportional hazards model, including all the parameters statistically significant at univariate analysis, demonstrated that {mGPS}, lymph node ratio ({LNR}), and positive resection margins were independent negative prognostic factors Conclusions Margin involvement, {LNR}, and the preoperative {mGPS} were identified as independent predictors of survival in patients undergoing potentially curative pancreatic resection. Based on the present results and existing validation literature, the {mGPS} should be included in the routine assessment of patients with pancreatic cancer to better stratify patients for entry into therapeutic trials.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of body mass index ({BMI}) on the short- and long-term outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention ({PCI}).
Background
Obesity is associated with advanced coronary artery disease ({CAD}). However, the relation between {BMI} and outcome after {PCI} remains controversial.
Methods
We studied 9,633 consecutive patients who underwent {PCI} between January 1994 and December 1999. Patients were divided into three groups according to {BMI}: normal, {BMI} between 18.5 and 24.9 (n = 1,923); overweight, {BMI} between 25 and 30 (n = 4,813); and obese, {BMI} \&gt;30 (n = 2,897).
Results
Obese patients were significantly younger and had consistently worse baseline clinical characteristics than normal or overweight patients, with a higher incidence of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and smoking history (p \&lt; 0.0001). Despite similar angiographic success rates among the three groups, normal {BMI} patients had a higher incidence of major in-hospital complications, including cardiac death (p = 0.001). At one-year follow-up, overall mortality rates were significantly higher for normal {BMI} patients compared with overweight or obese patients (p \&lt; 0.0001). Myocardial infarction and revascularization rates did not differ among the three groups. By multivariate Cox regression analysis, diabetes, hypertension, age, {BMI} and left ventricular function were independent predictors of long-term mortality.
Conclusions
In patients with known {CAD} who undergo {PCI}, very lean patients ({BMI} \&lt;18.5) and those with {BMI} within the normal range are at the highest risk for in-hospital complications and cardiac death and for increased one-year mortality.},

This study aims to examine the theoretical impact on neoplasia detection rates of a sigmoidoscopy-first protocol in {FOBt}-positive patients undergoing colonoscopy. {METHOD}: From retrieved endoscopy/pathology reports, pathology up to and including the splenic flexure was assumed detectable by sigmoidoscopy. High-risk polyps prompting subsequent colonoscopy were classed as three or more polyps, one polyp  of {\textgreater}/= 1 cm, villous or tubulovillous components or the presence of high-grade dysplasia. {RESULTS}: Between April 2009 and April 2011, 4631 patients underwent colonoscopy as a result of a positive {FOBt} in Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Cancer was detected in 398 (9\%) and adenomas were detected in 1985 (47\%) of which 1323 (67\%) were deemed significant according to British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. Applying the flexible sigmoidoscopy-first model, cancer would have been detected in 329 (8\%) patients and adenomas in 1640 (39\%), of which 1140 (70\%) would have been significant. In total, 1546 (37\%) patients would have required subsequent colonoscopy, following which 21 patients would have a new diagnosis of cancer. The positive predictive values ({PPVs}) for neoplasia (47 vs 57\%, P {\textless} 0.001), significant neoplasia (35 vs 41\%, P {\textless} 0.001) and cancer (8 vs 9\%, P = 0.007) were all lower in the sigmoidoscopy-first model. {CONCLUSION}: A significant reduction in the detection of both adenomas and cancers would be seen if the sigmoidoscopy-first protocol were to be used following a positive {FOBt}. Furthermore, a significant proportion of patients would be subjected to two procedures, with considerable implications for both the patient and cost.},

In addition, from previous work, the systemic inflammatory response and psychological distress appear to be related to fatigue. {METHODS}: Thirty-eight patients with metastatic or locally advanced lung carcinoma and 15 age-matched and gender-matched, healthy controls completed the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale, a visual analogue weakness score, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression ({HAD}) scale. Hemoglobin concentrations, C-reactive protein ({CRP}) concentrations, creatine kinase concentrations, white blood cell count, body composition, Karnofsky performance status ({KPS}), grip strength, and chair-rise time also were measured in both groups. The cancer patients were then grouped into tertiles on the basis of fatigue scores. {RESULTS}: The cancer patients had greater fatigue compared with the control group (P {\textless} 0.001). They also weighed less, had lower hemoglobin and creatine kinase levels and higher {CRP} levels, and had lower {KPS}, poorer grip strength, longer chair-rise times, and increased {HAD} scale scores (all P {\textless} 0.01). {KPS} and chair-rise time were correlated strongly (r(2) = 0.565; P {\textless} 0.001).

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The authors reviewed the pathology, complications, and outcomes in a consecutive group of 650 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy in the 1990s. {SUMMARY} {BACKGROUND} {DATA}: Pancreaticoduodenectomy has been used increasingly in recent years to resect a variety of malignant and benign diseases of the pancreas and periampullary region. {METHODS}: Between January 1990 and July 1996, inclusive, 650 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenal resection at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Data were recorded prospectively on all patients. All pathology specimens were reviewed and categorized. Statistical analyses were performed using both univariate and multivariate models. {RESULTS}: The patients had a mean age of 63 +/- 12.8 years, with 54\% male and 91\% white. The number of resections per year rose from 60 in 1990 to 161 in 1995. Pathologic examination results showed pancreatic cancer (n = 282; 43\%), ampullary cancer (n = 70; 11\%), distal common bile duct cancer (n = 65; 10\%), duodenal cancer (n = 26; 4\%), chronic pancreatitis (n = 71; 11\%), neuroendocrine tumor (n = 31; 5\%), periampullary adenoma (n = 21; 3\%), cystadenocarcinoma (n = 14; 2\%), cystadenoma (n = 25; 4\%), and other (n = 45; 7\%). The surgical procedure involved pylorus preservation in 82\%, partial pancreatectomy in 95\%, and portal or superior mesenteric venous resection in 4\%. Pancreatic-enteric reconstruction, when appropriate, was via pancreaticojejunostomy in 71\% and pancreaticogastrostomy in 29\%. The median intraoperative blood loss was 625 {mL}, median units of red cells transfused was zero, and the median operative time was 7 hours. During this period, 190 consecutive pancreaticoduodenectomies were performed without a mortality. Nine deaths occurred in-hospital or within 30 days of operation (1.4\% operative mortality). The postoperative complication rate was 41\%, with the most common complications being early delayed gastric emptying (19\%), pancreatic fistula (14\%), and wound infection (10\%). Twenty-three patients required reoperation in the immediate postoperative period (3.5\%), most commonly for bleeding, abscess, or dehiscence. The median postoperative length of stay was 13 days. A multivariate analysis of the 443 patients with periampullary adenocarcinoma indicated that the most powerful independent predictors favoring long-term survival included a pathologic diagnosis of duodenal adenocarcinoma, tumor diameter {\textless}3 cm, negative resection margins, absence of lymph node metastases, well-differentiated histology, and no reoperation. {CONCLUSIONS}: This single institution, high-volume experience indicates that pancreaticoduodenectomy can be performed safely for a variety of malignant and benign disorders of the pancreas and periampullary region. Overall survival is determined largely by the pathology within the resection specimen.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients have limited options for disease control. Local ablation technologies based on thermal damage have been used but are associated with major complications in this region of the pancreas. Irreversible electroporation ({IRE}) is a nonthermal ablation technology that we have shown is safe near vital vascular and ductal structures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of {IRE} as a therapy in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
{STUDY} {DESIGN}: We performed a prospective multi-institutional pilot evaluation of patients undergoing {IRE} for locally advanced pancreatic cancer from December 2009 to March 2011. These patients were evaluated for 90-day morbidity, mortality, and local disease control.
{RESULTS}: Twenty-seven patients (13 women and 14 men) underwent {IRE}, with median age of 61 years (range 45 to 80 years). Eight patients underwent margin accentuation with {IRE} in combination with left-sided resection (n = 4) or pancreatic head resection (n = 4). Nineteen patients had in situ {IRE}. All patients underwent successful {IRE}, with intraoperative imaging confirming effective delivery of therapy. All 27 patients demonstrated nonclinically relevant elevation of their amylase and lipase, which peaked at 48 hours and returned to normal at 72 hour postprocedure. There has been one 90-day mortality. No patient has shown evidence of clinical pancreatitis or fistula formation. After all patients have completed 90-day follow-up, there has been 100\% ablation success.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {IRE} ablation of locally advanced pancreatic cancer tumors is a safe and feasible primary local treatment in unresectable, locally advanced disease. Confirming these early results must occur in a planned phase {II} investigational device exemption ({IDE}) study to be initiated in 2012.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}/{AIMS}: Preoperative biliary drainage ({PBD}) in jaundiced patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy remains controversial. {METHODOLOGY}: Retrospective analysis of 313 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy between 1991 and 2004 was performed. Patients were stratified into {PBD} and no preoperative biliary drainage ({NPBD}) groups. Perioperative morbidity and mortality were evaluated and surgical risks compared. Nine retrospective studies were also evaluated. {RESULTS}: {PBD} was performed in 210; 103 had {NPBD}. Common indications for {PBD} were jaundice and cholangitis. Postoperative complications occurred in 153; 20 died postoperatively. {PBD} patients were older and predominantly male. Cholangitis, low albumin, and higher preoperative bilirubin were increased in {PBD}. Pancreatic leakage and postoperative hospital days were increased in {NPBD}. Wound infection occurred more frequently in {PBD}, but this was not significant. Perioperative mortality rate was 6.7\% in {PBD} compared to 5.8\% in {NPBD}. Postoperative complication rate was 45.7\% for {PBD} and 55.3\% for {NPBD}. Twelve {PBD} patients had procedure-related complications. Of 2391 patients pooled from the nine reviews and our study (1516 {PBD} and 875 {NPBD}), no significant difference was observed in postoperative mortality and overall complications. Wound infection was significantly increased in {PBD} (p{\textless}0.001). {CONCLUSIONS}: Preoperative biliary drainage did not increase postoperative morbidity and mortality rate in pancreaticoduodenectomy patients, but should be used judiciously.},

	abstract = {Cholestatic jaundice is the result of a malignancy of the bile duct itself, of the gallbladder, of the ampulla or (as in most cases) of the pancreas. Patients without evidence of metastases or other signs of advanced cancer (e.g. ascites) are candidates for explorative laparotomy. In the vast majority of cases resection of a tumor is not feasible and the surgeon is faced with the objective of providing palliation. To date there exists not only one palliative procedure, and the surgeon has to take into account the following: In patients with pancreatic cancer palliation can be given with biliary bypass with or without gastroenterostomy. This carries an operative mortality of almost 20\% and means a survival of only 5-6 months. Nonsurgical procedures as transpapillary stenting play an increasing role in the management of patients with obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic cancer. In some cases however resectable tumors perhaps will be overlooked. The results of controlled studies comparing endoscopic stenting and surgical bypass are encouraging for stenting techniques (lower morbidity and mortality ({\textless} 10\%), technical success rates exceeding 90\%). The availability of different palliative treatment modalities for carcinoma of the bile ducts suggests that no approach is definitely superior. Operative biliary-enteric anastomosis gives a tolerable operative mortality rate in younger patients, less morbidity, than external biliary drainage by better quality of life of the patients. In retrograde placement of prosthetic stents, in patients with high bile duct obstruction difficulties are frequently. In such cases the percutaneous drainage should be reserved for endoscopic failures, in cases the endoscopic and percutaneous approaches can be combined in the 'rendezvous' procedure. In recent years several reports have advocated extensive surgery for biliary neoplasms. Preoperative staging of these patients remains an issue as none of the commonly modalities are accurate in predicting resectability.},

	abstract = {{STUDY} {OBJECTIVES}: The number of severely obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery is increasing. No incremental cycle ergometer data are available in this category of patients. The current study was undertaken to provide information and to compare outcomes between severely obese men and women during physical exercise.
{DESIGN}: Cross-sectional study.
{PARTICIPANTS}: Twenty-two men and 34 women, all with a body mass index ({BMI}) of at least 40 kg/m(2), were selected from among persons participating in a dedicated weight management program that was carried out in the outpatient clinic of a large teaching hospital.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Body composition was estimated with bioelectrical impedance. Oxygen uptake (Vo(2)) was obtained by breath-by-breath minute ventilation (ventilated hood) and was measured under resting energy expenditure ({REE}) conditions. Endurance was measured with an incremental cycle ergometer test. Male and female groups were balanced for mean (+/- {SD}) age (42.7 +/- 7.6 vs 41.8 +/- 8.9 years, respectively), {BMI} (43.0 +/- 4.9 vs 41.3 +/- 5.2 kg/m(2), respectively), and fat weight (55.5 +/- 14.0 vs 56.8 +/- 2.2 kg, respectively). Fat-free mass ({FFM}), {FFM} index, fasting blood glucose level, insulin level, {REE}, and Vo(2) at rest and during subjective maximal endurance were higher in the male group. However, maximal Vo(2) (women, 119 +/- 19\% predicted; men, 92 +/- 16\% predicted) and anaerobic threshold were higher in the female group (women, 64 +/- 12\% predicted; men, 48 +/- 76\% predicted, respectively; p {\textless} 0.0001).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Severely obese men were more carbohydrate-intolerant and sustained less physical endurance than was predicted according to standards in comparison with obese women. The cycle ergometer data indicated that male gender was associated with less physical fitness.},

Albumin levels, total body water and 24-h urinary creatinine clearance were also  measured.

In this work, we compare the two most frequent techniques of reconstruction after {PD}, pancreatojejunostomy ({PJ}) and pancreatogastrostomy ({PG}), in order to determine which of the two is better. A systematic review of the literature was performed, including major meta-analysis articles, clinical randomized trials, systematic reviews, and retrospective studies. A total of 64 articles were finally included. {PJ} and {PG} are usually responsible for most of the postoperative morbidity, mainly due to the onset of {PF}, being considered a major trigger of life-threatening complications such as intra-abdominal abscess and hemorrhagia. The included systematic reviews reported a significant difference only in the incidence of intraabdominal collections favouring {PG}. {PF}, delayed gastric emptying and mortality were not different. Although there was heterogeneity between these studies, all were conducted in specialized centers by highly experienced surgeons, and the surgical care was likely to be similar for all the studies. The disadvantages of {PG} include an increased incidence of delayed gastric emptying and of main pancreatic duct obstruction due to overgrowth by the gastric mucosa. Exocrine function appears to be worse after {PG} than after {PJ}, resulting in severe atrophic changes in the remnant pancreas. Depending on the type of {PJ} or {PG} used, the {PF} rate and other complications can also be different. The best method to deal with the pancreatic stump after {PD} remains questionable. The choice of method of pancreatic anastomosis could be based on individual experience and on the surgeon’s preference and adherence to basic principles such as good exposure and visualization. In conclusion, up to now none of the techniques can be considered superior or be recommended as standard for reconstruction after {PD}.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Increasing chronological age is a risk factor for many types of cancer including colorectal. An understanding of the biology of aging and factors which  regulate it may provide insight into cancer pathogenesis. The role of telomere biology in both the cancer and aging process could prove useful in this regard. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: Using quantitative {PCR}, we determined telomere length in the peripheral blood leukocytes of 64 colorectal cancer ({CRC}) patients and 1,348 controls. We also measured telomere length in 32 colorectal tumor samples and matched normal tissue. We aimed to assess whether telomere lengths were reflected in circulating mediators of inflammation and redox control factors, including fetuin-A, a circulating modulator of calcium homeostasis. {RESULTS}: {CRC} patients had shorter telomeres [adjusted mean ratio of relative telomere repeat copy number to single-copy gene number ({RelT}/S) = 0.61] compared with chronologically  older controls (mean age = 75, adjusted mean {RelT}/S = 0.70; {ANCOVA}, P = 0.004). Telomere length in tumor tissue [median = 0.43, interquartile range ({IQR}) = 0.40] was significantly shorter than adjacent normal tissue (median = 0.65, {IQR} = 0.28; P = 0.004). Patients with low fetuin-A levels were shown to have significantly shorter telomeres (P = 0.041). Patients with rectal tumors had significantly higher levels of fetuin-A than those with colonic tumors (P = 0.045). {CONCLUSIONS}: We have observed that patients with {CRC} display clear evidence of telomere attrition compared with controls. This is congruent with accelerated biological aging in the pathogenesis of {CRC}. An imbalance in redox control mechanisms and calcium homeostasis may be a contributing factor to telomere dynamics in our patients. Furthermore, fetuin-A levels can be used to distinguish between colon and rectal cancers.},

	abstract = {Currently controversy exists whether bile infection following preoperative biliary drainage has an impact on postoperative complications and mortality rate. The objective of the study was to determine etiology of preoperative bile infection and to evaluate its influence on postoperative complications and mortality after pancreatoduodenectomy. {METHODS}: Data on 64 patients, undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy at Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital between 2002 and 2004 were collected prospectively. We evaluated etiology and the impact of bile infection on development of post-operative complications. Patients were divided into groups according to results of intraoperative bile culture. {RESULTS}: In 31 patients (48.4\%) intraoperative bile cultures were negative, while in remaining 33 patients (51.6\%) infected bile was documented. Both patient groups were homogenous according to demographic data, preoperative and intraoperative variables. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in 21 patients after preoperative biliary drainage (endoscopic stenting, bilidigestive anastomosis or percutaneous bile drainage), others (n=43) had primary operation. Infected bile was found more often in patients who underwent biliary drainage (p{\textless}0.0001). Among 43 patients with primary pancreaticoduodenectomy 22 patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography without stenting, while remaining 21 had no preoperative endoscopic manipulation. Infected bile was present in 9 patients after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (40.9\%) and in 4 without preoperative endoscopy (19\%). Enterococcus and Escherichia coli dominated in bile cultures of patients with primary pancreaticoduodenectomy, while multiple species (3 and more microorganisms) dominated following drainage procedures. Septic postoperative complications were identified in 26.6\% of cases. Infected bile did not influence both overall and septic postoperative complications. Bacteria causing abdominal cavity and wound infections matched bile cultures in 7.7\% of cases only. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our data show that infected bile is found more often after preoperative biliary drainage procedures. However, bile infection did not increase statistically significantly the number of postoperative septic complication.},

	abstract = {Background
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing measures oxygen uptake at increasing levels of work and predicts cardiopulmonary performance under conditions of stress, such as after abdominal surgery. Dynamic assessment of preoperative exercise capacity may be a useful predictor of postoperative prognosis. This study examined the relationship between preoperative exercise capacity and event-free survival in hepatocellular carcinoma ({HCC}) patients with chronic liver injury who underwent hepatectomy.

Methods
Sixty-one {HCC} patients underwent preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing to determine their anaerobic threshold ({AT}). The {AT} was defined as the break point between carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption per unit of time ({VO}2). Postoperative events including recurrence of {HCC}, death, liver failure, and complications of cirrhosis were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate associations between 35 clinical factors and outcomes, and identify independent prognostic indicators of event-free survival and maintenance of Child-Pugh class.

Results
Multivariate analyses identified preoperative branched-chain amino acid/tyrosine ratio ({BTR}) {\textless}5, alanine aminotransferase level ≥42 {IU}/l, and {AT} {VO}2 {\textless}11.5 ml/min/kg as independent prognostic indicators of event-free survival. {AT} {VO}2 {\textless}11.5 ml/min/kg and {BTR} {\textless}5 were identified as independent prognostic indicators of maintenance of Child-Pugh class.

Conclusions
This study identified preoperative exercise capacity as an independent prognostic indicator of event-free survival and maintenance of Child-Pugh class in {HCC} patients with chronic liver injury undergoing hepatectomy.},

Accurate measurement of {UCB} concentrations in cells, fluids and tissues is needed to evaluate its role in redox regulation, prevention of atherosclerotic and malignant diseases, and bilirubin encephalopathy. In the present study, we developed and validated a highly sensitive method for tissue {UCB} determinations. {UCB} was extracted from rat organs with chloroform/methanol/hexane at {pH} 6.2 and then partitioned into a minute volume of alkaline buffer that was subjected to {HPLC} using an octyl reverse phase ({RP}) column. Addition of mesobilirubin as an internal standard corrected for losses of {UCB} during extraction. Recoveries averaged 75+/-5\%. The detection limit was 10pmol {UCB}/g wet tissue. Variance was +/-2.5\%. When used to measure {UCB} concentrations in tissues of jaundiced Gunn rats, this procedure yielded {UCB} levels directly comparable to published methods, and accurately determined very low tissue bilirubin concentrations ({\textless}/=40pmol {UCB}/g tissue) in non-jaundiced rats.},

There was no difference in pancreatic {VEGF} concentrations between benign and malignant disease.

	abstract = {The adipose tissue volumes of 12 women were determined by computed tomography ({CT}). Body weight ranged from 46 to 129 kg. Nine or twenty-two transsectional scans were examined with respect to the adipose tissue area. The total adipose tissue volume ({ATCT}22 or {ATCT}9) was calculated by assuming linear changes in the adipose tissue area between adjacent scans. Body fat ({BF}) was also calculated from total body potassium ({BF}40K), from total body water ({BFTHO}), and from both these determinations ({BF}40K + {THO}). Body mass index ({BMI}) was calculated by dividing body weight ({BW}) by height2 (H2). {ATCT}22, {ATCT}9, and {BFK} were more closely related to {BW} and {BMI} than were {BFTHO} and {BF}40K + {THO}. When {ATCT} was used as a standard, the optimal index of adiposity based on {BW} and H was in the range {BW}/H0.8 to {BW}/H1.2. From the {CT} and 40K measurements it was possible to deduce that the potassium content is 62 mmol/kg fat free mass and 73-75 mmol/kg lean body mass. The error of {ATCT}9 was 0.6\%, while that of {BF}40K was at least three to four times larger. It is concluded that the {CT}-based {AT} determination is the most reproducible method so far available. The technique might turn out to be of great value in human energy balance experiments.},

There were significantly lower leptin concentrations in male (median, 2.4 microg/liter; range, {\textless}0.5-6.0 microg/liter) and female (median, 3.4 microg/liter; range, {\textless}0.5-9.8 microg/liter) cancer patients than there were in male (median, 6.5 microg/liter; range, 3.1-10.9 microg/liter) and female (median, 18.7 microg/liter; range, 8.0-31.5 mcirog/liter) healthy subjects (P {\textless} 0.001). However, the leptin concentrations in both patients and normal subjects were related to the predicted percentage of body fat (r = 0.731; P {\textless} 0.001). Circulating leptin concentrations in the cancer  patients were not altered by the presence of an inflammatory response. These results suggest that cancer anorexia/cachexia is not due to a simple dysregulation of leptin production.},

Plasma norepinephrine, heart rate, diastolic arterial pressure and cardiac function, as evaluated by systolic time intervals, were monitored. At rest, cirrhotics had higher norepinephrine (154 +/- 19 S.E.M. ng/l) and heart rate (79 +/- 2 beats per min) than controls (71 +/- 3 ng/l, p less than 0.01; 67 +/- 2 beats per min, p less than 0.001), whereas diastolic arterial pressure was similar. Among systolic time intervals, electromechanical systole, pre-ejection period, electromechanical delay and pre-ejection period to left ventricular ejection time ratios were prolonged (p less than 0.05 or less). Exercise led to significant increases in plasma norepinephrine, heart rate and diastolic arterial pressure in both controls and patients. In the latter, however, whereas the increase in norepinephrine was greater (p less than 0.001), those in heart rate and diastolic arterial pressure were less (p less than 0.005). As expected, most systolic time intervals shortened, but the decrease in pre-ejection period (p less than 0.05), isometric contraction time (p less than 0.02) and pre-ejection period to left ventricular ejection time ratio (p = 0.06) was less in patients than in controls. Direct correlations between exercise-induced changes in norepinephrine and both diastolic arterial pressure (r = 0.81; p less than 0.005) and heart rate (r = 0.85; p less than 0.002) were observed in controls, while inverse correlations (r = -0.67, p less than 0.001 and r = -0.44; p less than 0.05) were found in cirrhotics. These results suggest that cardiovascular reactivity to the sympathetic drive is impaired in cirrhotics. The impairment of cardiac contractility may be due to altered electromechanical coupling.},

{SUMMARY} {BACKGROUND} {DATA}: Obesity has long been considered a risk factor for poor outcomes from a variety of surgical procedures, yet recent studies of critically and chronically ill patients suggest that overweight and obese patients may paradoxically have better outcomes than "normal" weight patients.
{METHODS}: A prospective, multi-institutional, risk-adjusted cohort study of 118,707 patients undergoing nonbariatric general surgery who were included in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use database in 2005 and 2006 was performed. Outcomes and risk variables were compared across {NIH}-defined {BMI} class using analysis of variance, Bonferroni multiple comparisons of means tests, and multivariable logistic regression.
{RESULTS}: After adjusting for all significant perioperative risk factors, the risk of death according to {BMI} exhibited a reverse J-shaped relationship, with the highest rates in the underweight and morbidly obese extremes and the lowest rates in the overweight and moderately obese. Overweight (odds ratio, 0.85; 95\% {CI}, 0.75-0.99) and moderately obese (odds ratio, 0.73; 95\% {CI}, 0.57-0.94) patients had a significantly lower risk of death than normal weight patients. There was a progressive increase in the likelihood of a complication with increasing {BMI} class, almost entirely due to increasing rates of wound infection.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Overweight and moderately obese patients undergoing nonbariatric general surgery have paradoxically "lower" crude and adjusted risks of mortality compared with patients at a "normal" weight. This finding is in contrast to observations from the general population, confirming the existence of an "obesity paradox" in this patient population.},

It allows accurate, meaningful inter-provider comparison. It is therefore an essential component of any audit and quality improvement process. The aim of this study was to review the literature to identify those factors known to affect prognosis in hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancer surgery. Methods: {PubMed} was used to identify studies assessing risk in patients undergoing resection surgery, rather than bypass surgery, for hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancer. Results: In total, 63 and 68 papers, pertaining to 24 609 and 63 654 patients who underwent hepatic or pancreatic resection for malignancy, respectively, were identified. Overall, 22 generic preoperative factors predicting outcome on multivariate analysis, including demographics, blood results, preoperative biliary drainage and co-morbidities, were identified, with tumour characteristics proving disease-specific factors. Operative duration, transfusion, operative extent, vascular resection and additional intra-abdominal procedures were also found to be predictive of early outcome. Conclusions: The development of a risk adjustment model will allow for the identification of those factors with most influence on early outcome and will thus identify potential targets for preoperative optimization and allow for the development of a multicentre risk prediction model.},

	abstract = {Obstructive jaundice model was created using rats by the ligation of bile duct. One, 2, 3 weeks later, the respiratory function and morphology of the hepatic mitochondria were comparatively evaluated between mitochondria directly fractionated from liver tissue and mitochondria from isolated hepatocytes. Respiratory function of the former deteriorated with the duration of jaundice. {ATP} synthesis decreased to 75\% of the control at 1 and 2 weeks, and 58\% at 3 weeks after ligation. On the contrary, it was 97\%, 88\% and 87\% of the control. On the contrary, it was 97\%, 88\% and 87\% of the control at 1, 2 and 3 weeks in the latter. By electron microscopic examination, the size of mitochondria of the jaundiced liver is inconsistent and smaller in general than the control. These data suggest that the deterioration of mitochondrial function in the jaundiced liver is not caused mainly by the disturbance of mitochondria themselves, but caused by the respiratory inhibitory factors which exist around the mitochondria.},

	abstract = {1. The impact of ventilatory efficiency on reduced exercise capacity and recovery oxygen kinetics has not been addressed in cirrhotic patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate exercise performance and ventilatory efficiency in patients with mild and moderate liver cirrhosis ({LC}). 2. Nineteen male non-hypoxic patients with {LC} (age 51.3 +/- 9.1 years; body mass index ({BMI}) 25.6 +/- 3.6 kg/m(2)) classified by the Child-Pugh score as class A (n = 7) and class B (n = 12) and 19 age- and {BMI}-matched controls participated in the study. Subjects undertook maximal incremental exercise testing on a treadmill using the Bruce protocol. 3. Patients with {LC} showed a reduced diffusion capacity (D(L,{CO})\%) compared with controls (74.6 +/- 15.2 vs 95.6 +/- 12.9\%, respectively; P {\textless} 0.001), but a comparable volume standardized diffusion coefficient (1.33 +/- 0.22 vs 1.45 +/- 0.18 mmol/min per {kPa} per L, respectively; P = 0.74). Patients with {LC} had a significantly lower exercise capacity compared with controls ({VO}(2 max) 23.8 +/- 3.8 vs 30.6 +/- 4.4 {mL}/min per kg, respectively; P {\textless} 0.001). Recovery oxygen kinetics were also impaired in {LC} patients compared with controls (104.6 +/- 19.3 vs 84.4 +/- 22.7 s, respectively; P = 0.012). The chronotropic index was significantly lower in the {LC} group compared with controls (0.67 +/- 0.19 vs 0.82 +/- 0.17, respectively; P = 0.030) and {LC} patients showed higher ventilatory equivalents (30.4 +/- 3.8 vs 26.3 +/- 2.3, respectively; P {\textless} 0.001) and lower oxygen uptake efficiency slope values (2187 +/- 445 vs 2745 +/- 473 {mL}/min per log(10)L, respectively; P {\textless} 0.001) compared with controls, which is indicative of decreased ventilatory efficiency. Patients with {LC} also had a higher standardized maximal exercise perception score ({SMEPS}) compared with controls (0.62 +/- 0.18 vs 0.46 +/- 0.15, respectively; P = 0.011). Moderate negative correlations were found between Child-Pugh score and {VO}(2 max)\% (r = -0.496; P = 0.031). 4. In conclusion, patients with mild and moderate {LC} have reduced exercise capacity, which correlates with Child-Pugh score, as well as reduced chronotropic index and prolonged recovery oxygen uptake kinetics. The results suggest worsened ventilatory efficiency during exercise and cardiopulmonary reasons for the higher {SMEPS} in these patients.},

The aim of this study was to characterize bile contamination to develop successful specific antibiotic prophylactic strategies for pancreatoduodenectomy. {METHODS}: Ninety-one consecutive patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy for periampullary tumor were prospectively evaluated. Prophylactic antibiotics were selected based on preoperative bile cultures. Bile cultures and postoperative complications were compared in 46 patients who underwent {PBD} (drainage group) versus 45 patients who did not (nondrainage group). {RESULTS}: The incidence of positive bile cultures was higher in the drainage group (78\%) than in the nondrainage group (36\%) (P {\textless} 0.001). In the drainage group, positive bile cultures were frequently polymicrobial (61\%) and demonstrated resistance to several antibiotics, including cefazolin (83\%), cefmetazole (72\%), and cefpirome (64\%). Overall morbidity (30\% and 22\%) and infectious morbidity (13\% and 11\%) did not differ significantly between the drainage and nondrainage groups, respectively. {CONCLUSIONS}: {PBD} had a notable influence on bile microbial contamination, including a higher rate of antibiotic resistance.

	abstract = {Objective
To investigate whether the positive association of body mass index ({BMI}, kg/m2) with risk of pancreatic cancer is modified by age, sex, smoking status, physical activity, and history of diabetes.

Methods
In a pooled analysis of primary data of seven prospective cohorts including 458,070 men and 485,689 women, we identified 2,454 patients with incident pancreatic cancer during an average 6.9 years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used in data analysis.

Results
In a random-effects meta-analysis, for every 5 kg/m2 increment in {BMI}, the summary relative risk ({RR}) was 1.06 (95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.99–1.13) for men and 1.12 (95\% {CI} 1.05–1.19) for women. The aggregate analysis showed that compared with normal weight ({BMI}: 18.5 to {\textless}25), the adjusted {RR} was 1.13 (95\% {CI} 1.03–1.23) for overweight ({BMI}: 25 to {\textless}30) and 1.19 (95\% {CI} 1.05–1.35) for obesity class I ({BMI}: 30 to {\textless}35). Tests of interactions of {BMI} effects by other risk factors were not statistically significant. Every 5 kg/m2 increment in {BMI} was associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer among never and former smokers, but not among current smokers (P-interaction = 0.08).

Conclusion
The present evidence suggests that a high {BMI} is an independent risk factor of pancreatic cancer.},

	url = {http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7620083},
	abstract = {The association between obstructive jaundice and postoperative acute renal failure has been originally described more than eight decades ago and is now a well-established clinical phenomenon. Acute renal failure occurs in 8 to 10\% of patients requiring surgery for relief of obstructive jaundice and contributes to eventual mortality in 70 to 80\% of those who develop it. A major factor that may underlie the susceptibility to renal failure in patients with obstructive jaundice is cardiovascular instability manifested as systemic hypotension and defective vascular reactivity. This article outlines the scope of the clinical association between jaundice and renal failure and reviews the clinical and experimental studies that have contributed to our understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms for this phenomenon. A growing body of evidence emanating from these studies indicates that bile constituents (e.g., bile acids, bilirubin, cholesterol) do not exert a direct nephrotoxic effect. Rather, the retention of bile during cholestatic jaundice has deleterious effects on cardiovascular function and on blood volume. This, in turn, sensitizes the kidney to prerenal failure and acute tubular necrosis in postsurgical patients with obstructive jaundice. The institution of prophylactic measures based on the appreciation of these underlying pathogenic mechanisms may result in an improvement in the overall prognosis of jaundiced patients undergoing surgery.},

	abstract = {Although the first studies highlighting the importance of the tumour inflammatory cell infiltrate were reported more than 80 years ago, the prognostic value of this response in breast cancer is still controversial. With the realisation of the importance of the inflammatory response in determining tumour progression there has been renewed interest in establishing the relationship between the type, density and location of inflammatory cell infiltrate and survival in patients with primary operable breast cancer. The aim was to undertake a systematic review of the literature examining the evidence for the role of the tumour inflammatory cell infiltrate in predicting recurrence and survival in patients with primary operable breast cancer. A systematic review of published papers up to September 2011 was undertaken according to a pre-defined protocol (Fig. 1). A total of 66 independent studies (34,086 patients) were identified. It can be concluded from the review that despite the large number of studies and considerable effort over an extended period, the relationship between different aspects of tumour inflammatory cell infiltrate and outcome in primary operable breast cancer remains unclear. This is in large part due to the absence of methodological validation, underpowered studies (small sample size and sample subtype heterogeneity, insufficient follow-up) and the absence of validation datasets. Therefore, although there are tantalising examples of the potential of  the tumour inflammatory cell infiltrate to improve risk stratification patients with operable breast cancer (personalised care), this has not yet been realised.  Future studies with standardised methodology, large and homogenous groups, sufficient follow-up and validation datasets should be undertaken to unlock the potential of the tumour inflammatory infiltrate to predict outcome in patients with primary operable breast cancer.},

Results were available for eight patients in the 28 degrees C group but for only seven in the  20 degrees C group (one patient in this group was excluded as the temperature allocated was not achieved). The groups were similar with respect to body-weight  and lean body mass. The 20 degrees C group received more grafts than the 28 degrees C group, resulting in an increase in cross-clamp and bypass times. Mean preoperative {TEE} was similar in both groups. The mean difference in fractional turnover rates of hydrogen and oxygen was not significantly different in the postoperative period. There was a non-significant increase in the mean 10-day postoperative {TEE}, calculated in total calories, of 4.7 per cent in the 28 degrees C and 5.1 per cent in the 20 degrees C group. When changes in postoperative {TEE} were calculated according to lean body mass, the mean increases were respectively 3.7 and 3.2 per cent. Cardiac surgery utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass and intraoperative hypothermia results in only a modest increase in postoperative {TEE}. In this study a more profound level of intraoperative hypothermia did not influence the change in postoperative {TEE}.},

	url = {http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18787902},
	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Despite the widespread use of endoscopic biliary stenting in patients presenting with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer, there is no general consensus regarding whether this represents a superior management approach over expeditious surgical intervention. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of preoperative biliary stenting and resolution of jaundice on subsequent postoperative survival following resection for pancreatic cancer. {METHODS}: 155 patients undergoing partial pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma between January 1997 and August 2007 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. {RESULTS}: There was no survival difference when comparing patients undergoing preoperative biliary drainage (n = 130) with those who did not (n = 25) (log rank, P = 0.981). When analysing individual prognostic factors as continuous variables in univariate Cox analysis, lower albumin levels (P = 0.016), elevated alkaline phosphatase levels (P = 0.011) and elevated {CRP} levels (P = 0.021) were associated with poorer overall survival. Multivariable Cox regression demonstrated that both albumin (P = 0.008) and {CRP} (P = 0.038) remained significant independent predictors of overall survival alongside lymph node ratio (P = 0.018). Although preoperative bilirubin levels were not associated with overall survival when analysed as a continuous variable (Cox, P = 0.786), the presence of jaundice (i.e., bilirubin {\textgreater}35 micromol/l) at the time of surgery was a significant adverse predictor of early survival in patients undergoing preoperative biliary drainage (Breslow-Gehan-Wilcoxon, P = 0.013) and remained a significant predictor of early survival when included in a further Cox analysis with censoring of cases who survived beyond 6 months (Cox, P = 0.017). {CONCLUSION}: These results suggest that the presence of jaundice at the time of resection has an adverse impact on early, but not overall, postoperative survival in pancreatic cancer patients undergoing preoperative biliary drainage.},

	doi = {10.1038/bjc.2014.279},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The percentage of tumour stroma ({TSP}) has recently been reported to be a novel independent predictor of outcome in patients with a variety of common  solid organ tumours. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between {TSP}, clinicopathological characteristics and outcome in patients with invasive ductal breast cancer, in particular node negative and triple negative disease. {METHODS}: A total of 361 patients with primary operable invasive ductal breast cancer were included in this study. The {TSP} was assessed visually on the haematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections. With a cutoff value of 50\% {TSP}, patients with {\textless}/= 50\% stroma were classified as the low-{TSP} group and those with  {\textgreater}50\% stroma were classified as the high-{TSP} group. {RESULTS}: A total of 109 (30\%)  patients had high {TSP}. Patients with high {TSP} were old age (P=0.035), had more Her-2-positive tumours (P=0.029), low-grade tumour inflammatory infiltrate (P=0.034), low {CD}68+macrophage infiltrate (P{\textless}0.001), low {CD}4+ (P=0.023) and low {CD}8+ T-lymphocytes infiltrate (P=0.017), tumour recurrence (P=0.015) and shorter  cancer-specific survival (P{\textless}0.001). In node-negative patients (n=207), high {TSP} was associated with low {CD}68+macrophage infiltrate (P=0.001), low {CD}4+ (P=0.040)  and low {CD}8+ T-lymphocytes infiltrate (P=0.016) and shorter cancer-specific survival (P=0.005). In triple negative patients (n=151), high {TSP} was associated  with high tumour grade (P={\textless}0.001), lymph node positivity (P=0.027), low {CD}68+macrophage infiltrate (P=0.011) and shorter cancer-specific survival (P=0.035). The 15-year cancer-specific survival rate was 79\% vs 21\% in the low-{TSP} group vs high-{TSP} group. In multivariate survival analysis, a high {TSP} was associated with reduced cancer-specific survival in the whole cohort (P=0.001), node-negative patients (P=0.007) and those who received systemic adjuvant therapy (P=0.021), independent of other pathological characteristics including host inflammatory response. However, {TSP} was not an independent prognostic factor for triple negative patients (P=0.151). {CONCLUSIONS}: A high {TSP} in primary operable invasive ductal breast cancer was associated with recurrence  and poorer long-term survival. The inverse relation with the tumour inflammatory  infiltrate highlights the importance of the amount of tumour stroma on immunological response in patients with primary operable ductal breast cancer. Implementing this simple and reproducible parameter in routine pathological examination may help optimise risk stratification in patients with invasive ductal breast cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Population-based colorectal cancer screening has been shown to reduce cancer specific mortality and is used across the {UK}. Despite evidence that older  age, male sex and deprivation are associated with an increased incidence of colorectal cancer, uptake of bowel cancer screening varies across demographic groups. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of age, sex and deprivation on outcomes throughout the screening process. {METHODS}: A prospectively maintained database, encompassing the first screening round of a faecal occult blood test screening programme in a single geographical area, was analysed. {RESULTS}: Overall, 395,096 individuals were invited to screening, 204,139 (52\%) participated and 6079 (3\%) tested positive. Of the positive tests,  4625 (76\%) attended for colonoscopy and cancer was detected in 396 individuals (9\%). Lower uptake of screening was associated with younger age, male sex and deprivation (all p{\textless}0.001). Only deprivation was associated with failure to proceed to colonoscopy following a positive test (p{\textless}0.001). Despite higher positivity rates in those that were more deprived (p{\textless}0.001), the likelihood of detecting cancer in those attending for colonoscopy was lower (8\% most deprived vs 10\% least deprived, p = 0.003). {CONCLUSION}: Individuals who are deprived are less likely to participate in screening, less likely to undergo colonoscopy and less likely to have cancer identified as a result of a positive test. Therefore,  this study suggests that strategies aimed at improving participation of deprived  individuals in colorectal cancer screening should be directed at all stages of the screening process and not just uptake of the test.},

	volume = {244},
	url = {http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17122618},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To define a simple and reproducible classification of complications following pancreaticoduodenectomy ({PD}) based on a therapy-oriented severity grading system. {BACKGROUND}: While mortality is rare after {PD}, morbidity rates remain high. The lack of standardization in evaluating morbidity after {PD} has severely hampered meaningful comparisons over time and among centers. We adapted a novel classification of complication to stratify morbidity by severity after {PD}, to test whether the incidence of pancreatic fistula has changed over time, and to identify risk factors in a single North American center. {METHODS}: The classification was applied to a consecutive series of 633 patients undergoing {PD} between February 2003 and August 2005. Another series of 141 patients treated between 1987 and 1990 was also analyzed to identify changes in the incidence and severity of fistula. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to link respective complications with preoperative and intraoperative parameters, length of hospital stay, and long-term survival. {RESULTS}: A total of 263 (41.5\%) patients did not develop any complication, while 370 (58.5\%) had at least one complication; 62 (10.0\%) patients had only grade I complications (no need for specific intervention), 192 patients (30.0\%) had grade {II} (need for drug therapy such as antibiotics), 85 patients (13.5\%) had grade {III} (need for invasive therapy), and 19 patients (3.0\%) had grade {IV} complications (organ dysfunction with {ICU} stay). Grade V (death) occurred in 12 patients (2.0\%). A total of 57 patients (9.0\%) developed pancreatic fistula, of which 33 (58.0\%) were classified as grade {II}, 17 (30.0\%) as grade {III}, 5 (9.0\%) as grade {IV}, and 2 (3.5\%) as grade V. Delayed gastric emptying was documented in 80 patients (12.7\%); half of them were scored as grade {II} and the other half as grade {III}. A significant decrease in the incidence of fistula was observed between the 2 periods analyzed (14.0\% vs. 9.0\%, P {\textless} 0.001), mostly due to a decrease in grade {II} fistula. Cardiovascular disease was a risk factor for overall morbidity and complication severity, while texture of the gland and cardiovascular disease were risk factors for pancreatic fistula. {CONCLUSION}: This study demonstrates the applicability and utility of a new classification in grading complications following pancreatic surgery. This novel approach may provide a standardized, objective, and reproducible assessment of pancreas surgery enabling meaningful comparison among centers and over time.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Different tumor-specific prognostic factors have been identified in recent years for patients who undergo surgery due to pancreatic head cancer, but the results often were inconsistent. Furthermore, the impact of postoperative complications on patient long-term survival has not been described.
{METHODS}: The long-term outcome of 428 patients who underwent resection of pancreatic head cancer at our center during a 17-year period was evaluated. Perioperative details, including postoperative complications, as well as the follow-up of all patients who left the hospital postoperatively were collected in a prospective database. Univariate and multivariate models were used to identify potential prognostic factors and to evaluate the impact of postoperative complications on long-term survival.
{RESULTS}: The median survival was 15.5 months with a postoperative complication rate (grade I-{IV}) of 32.7\%. Independent prognostic significance was detected for grading (P {\textless} 0.001), R status (P = 0.001), and lymph node status (P = 0.003). The occurrence of severe postoperative complications (grade {III}-{IV}) was associated with a significantly shortened survival (16.5 vs. 12.4 months; P = 0.002) and was identified as an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.002).
{CONCLUSIONS}: This large study demonstrates that severe postoperative complications have a strong impact on the long-term survival of patients with pancreatic head cancer comparable to tumor characteristics, such as lymph node status, grading, or R status. As a result, the improvement of surgical procedures in specialized centers might lead to a survival benefit in these patients.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: There is some evidence that systemic inflammation may be associated with survival in patients with prostate cancer; however, it is unclear whether this is independent of grade. We therefore investigated the role of inflammation-based prognostic scores, the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score ({mGPS}) and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}), and their associations with Gleason grade in patients with prostate cancer. {METHODS}: Patients from a cohort, the Glasgow Inflammation Outcome Study, who had diagnosis of prostate cancer, were included in this study. The {mGPS} was constructed by combining C-reactive protein  and albumin whereas {NLR} by calculating the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes. We estimated 5-year relative survival and relative excess risk ({RER}) of death by  {mGPS} and {NLR} categories after adjusting for age, socioeconomic circumstances and  Gleason grade. {RESULTS}: In all, 897 prostate cancer patients were identified; of  those 422 (47\%) died during a maximum follow-up of 6.2 years. Systemic inflammation appeared to have significant prognostic value. The {mGPS} predicted poorer 5-year overall and relative survival independent of age, socioeconomic circumstances, disease grade and {NLR}. Raised {mGPS} also had a significant association with excess risk of death ({mGPS} 2: {RER} =2.41, 95\% confidence interval 1.37-4.23) among aggressive, clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason grades 8-10). {CONCLUSIONS}: The {mGPS} is a strong measure of systemic inflammation, when compared with {NLR}. Prostate cancer patients with a raised {mGPS} had significantly higher risk of death for overall as well high-grade disease. Inflammation-based prognostic scores predict outcome in patients with prostate cancer and should be added to their routine clinical assessment.},

Full biochemical and haematological data both pre- and post-operatively (3-6 months) were available for 206 patients. {RESULTS}: In 206 patients, there was no significant overall change in either the {mGPS} or the {NLR}, from pre- to post-operatively. On univariate survival analysis, T-stage (P{\textless}0.001), tumour, node, metastasis stage (P{\textless}0.005), pre-operative {mGPS} (P{\textless}0.05), pre-operative {NLR} ({\textless}0.05), post-operative {mGPS} (P{\textless}0.001) and post-operative {NLR} (P{\textless}0.005) were associated with cancer-specific survival. On multivariate survival analysis, comparing pre-operative {mGPS} and {NLR}, both pre-operative {mGPS} and {NLR} were independently associated with reduced cancer-specific survival ({mGPS} hazard  ratio ({HR}) 1.97, {CI} 1.16-3.34, P{\textless}0.05, and {NLR} {HR} 3.07, {CI} 1.23-7.63, P{\textless}0.05). When the same multivariate comparison was carried out on post-operative data, only the post-operative {mGPS} was independently associated with cancer-specific survival ({HR} 4.81, {CI} 2.13-10.83, P{\textless}0.001). {CONCLUSION}: The results of the present study support the longitudinal assessment of the systemic inflammatory response, in particular the {mGPS}, in patients undergoing potentially curative resection for {CRC}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The impact of postoperative complications on recurrence rate and long-term outcome has been reported in patients with colorectal and esophageal cancer, but not in patients with gastric cancer. This study evaluated the impact of postoperative intra-abdominal infectious complications on long-term survival following curative gastrectomy.
{METHODS}: This study included 765 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer between 2002 and 2006. Patients were divided into 2 groups: with (C-group, n = 81) or without ({NC}-group, n = 684) intra-abdominal infectious complications. Survival curves were compared between the groups, and multivariate analysis was conducted to identify independent prognostic factors.
{RESULTS}: Male patients were dominant, and total gastrectomy was frequently performed in the C-group. The pathological stage was more advanced and D2 lymph node dissection and splenectomy were preferred in the C-group. The 5-year overall survival ({OS}) rate was better in the {NC}-group (86.8 \%) than in the C-group (66.4 \%; P {\textless} .001). The 5-year relapse-free survival ({RFS}) rate was also better in the {NC}-group (84.5 \%) than in the C-group (64.9 \%; P {\textless} .001). This trend was still observed in stage {II} and {III} patients after stratification by pathological stage. Multivariate analysis identified intra-abdominal infectious complication as an independent prognostic factor for {OS} (hazard ratio, 2.448; 95 \% confidence interval [95 \% {CI}], 1.475-4.060) and {RFS} (hazard ratio, 2.219; 95 \% {CI}, 1.330-3.409) in patients with advanced disease.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Postoperative intra-abdominal infectious complications adversely affect {OS} and {RFS}. Meticulous surgery is needed to decrease the complication rate and improve the long-term outcome of patients following curative gastrectomy.},

{METHODS}: In total, 478 patients with advanced gastric cancer who underwent surgery with curative intent were reviewed. Anastomosis or duodenal stump leakage was diagnosed clinically or radiologically. Risk factors for leakage were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. The impact of leakage on patient survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
{RESULTS}: Leakage was diagnosed in 32 of 478 patients (6.7\%); 14 patients (2.9\%) exhibited esophagojejunal anastomotic leakage, 14 (2.9\%) showed duodenal stump leakage, and four (0.8\%) showed gastroduodenal anastomotic leakage. Poor performance status [odds ratio ({OR}): 4.01, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}): 1.80-8.93] and tumor location ({OR}: 3.74, 95\% {CI}: 1.56-8.89) were risk factors for postoperative leakage. Overall mean survival of patients with leakage was significantly lower than that of patients without leakage (30.5 vs. 96.2 months; P {\textless} 0.001). Leakage was one of the independent predictive factor for overall survival [hazard ratio ({HR}): 3.58, 95\% {CI}: 2.29-5.59].

{METHODS}: We retrospectively analyzed the predictive factors of relevant grade B/C {PF} using logistic regression analysis of 100 consecutive patients who underwent {PD}. {PF} was defined in accordance with the International Study Group on {PF} ({ISGPF}).
{RESULTS}: White blood cell count ({WBC}) of 73.6 × 10(2) /μl, C-reactive protein ({CRP}) of 9.3 mg/dl and amylase value in drains (d-amylase) of 647 U/I on postoperative day ({POD}) 4 were proposed as the cut-off values for predicting grade B/C {PF} with high accuracy by the receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curve. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the three factors as significant predictive factors and the predicted probability of detecting grade B/C {PF} was calculated by the following formula; P = 1/[1 + exp\{-(2.033 × {WBC}+3.269 × {CRP}+2.698 × d-amylase-4.122)\}]. P {\textgreater} 0.5 indicates the prospective incidence of the {PF}. When the cut-off values of the three significant predictors were substituted into the formula, P always showed above 0.5 if more than two predictors were above their cut-off values, indicating a high probability of grade B/C {PF}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: White blood cell count, {CRP} and d-amylase on {POD}4 were predictive factors for clinically relevant {PF} after {PD}. These findings indicate that our formula is useful for management of drain after {PD}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {AIMS}: Metabolic measurements (e.g. resting energy expenditure) are adjusted to lean body mass to account for body composition differences. Usually lean body mass is estimated from total body water. However, this may be compromised in weight-losing cancer patients owing to alterations in the degree of hydration of the lean body mass. This study examined the relationship between  two independent estimates of lean body mass in healthy subjects and cancer patients with weight loss. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Height, weight, total body water  and total body potassium were measured in healthy subjects (n=9) and weight losing cancer patients (n=13). They were similar in terms of age and gender. However, the cancer group had a significantly lower percentage ideal body weight  (P{\textless}0.001). The measured total body water values in both groups were similar to those predicted. In contrast, measured total body potassium values in the cancer  group were significantly lower than predicted (P{\textless}0.001). There was a correlation  between the ratio of measured lean body mass (water/lean bodymass (potassium) and the percentage weight loss (r=0.698, P{\textless}0.001). {CONCLUSIONS}: These results suggest that total body water significantly overestimates metabolically active tissue in  weight-losing cancer patients and therefore its use as the basis for metabolic requirements in this group of patients is questionable.},

Patients and Methods: This study included 164 patients who underwent curative surgery for pancreatic cancer between 2005 and 2014. The patients were classified into those with postoperative complications (C group) and those without postoperative complications ({NC} group). The risk factors for overall survival ({OS}) and recurrence-free survival ({RFS}) were identified. Results: Postoperative complications were found in 61 out of the 164 patients (37.2\%). The {RFS} rate at five years after surgery was 10.6\% in the C group and 21.0\% in the {NC} group. The {RFS} tended to be worse in the C group than in the {NC} group (p=0.1756). The {OS} rate at five years after surgery was 7.4\% in the C group and 22.8\% in the {NC} group, which was significantly different (p=0.0189). The multivariate analysis demonstrated that the occurrence of postoperative complications was a significant independent risk factor for {OS} and a marginally significant risk factor for {RFS}. Conclusion: The development of postoperative complications was a risk factor for a decreased overall survival in the patients who underwent curative surgery for pancreatic cancer.

It became evident then that the best index was the ratio of the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters, or the Quetelet Index described in 1832. Adolphe Quetelet (1796–1874) was a Belgian mathematician, astronomer and statistician, who developed a passionate interest in probability calculus that he applied to study human physical characteristics and social aptitudes. His pioneering cross-sectional studies of human growth led him to conclude that other than the spurts of growth after birth and during puberty, ‘the weight increases as the square of the height’, known as the Quetelet Index until it was termed the Body Mass Index in 1972 by Ancel Keys (1904–2004).
For his application of comparative statistics to social conditions and moral issues, Quetelet is considered a founder of the social sciences. His principal work, ‘A Treatise of Man and the development of his faculties’ published in 1835 is considered ‘one of the greatest books of the 19th century’. A tireless promoter of statistical data collection based on standard methods and definitions, Quetelet organized in 1853 the first International Statistical Congress, which launched the development of ‘a uniform nomenclature of the causes of death applicable to all countries’, progenitor of the current International Classification of Diseases.},

Tissue microarrays (n=379 patients) immunostained for Ki-67 were scored visually  and automatically with the Slidepath Tissue {IA} system. {RESULTS}: Visual and automated Ki-67 {LI} were in excellent agreement ({ICCC}=0.96, P{\textless}0.001). On univariate analysis, visual (P{\textless}0.001) and automated Ki67 {LI} (P{\textless}0.05) were associated with cancer-specific survival in patients with invasive ductal breast  cancer overall and in patients who received endocrine therapy (Tamoxifen) (P{\textless}0.01 for visual and P{\textless}0.05 for automated scoring). {CONCLUSION}: Automated assessment of Ki-67 {LI} would appear to be comparable to visual Ki-67 {LI}. However, automated Ki-67 {LI} assessment was inferior in predicting cancer survival in patients with breast cancer, including patients who received Tamoxifen.},

In addition, predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second should not be used alone for patient selection because it is not an accurate predictor of complications, particularly in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The use of exercise testing should be emphasized. Low-technology tests, such as stair climbing, can be used whenever a formal cardiopulmonary exercise test is not readily available. However, in case of suboptimal performance (ie, {\textless}22 m in the stair-climbing test) patients should be referred to cardiopulmonary exercise testing with measurement of Vo(2max) for a better definition of their aerobic reserve.

	abstract = {A single abdominal cross-sectional computerized axial tomography and magnetic resonance image is often obtained in studies examining adipose tissue ({AT}) distribution. An abdominal image might also provide additional useful information on total body skeletal muscle ({SM}) and {AT} volumes with related physiological insights. We therefore investigated the relationships between abdominal {SM} and {AT} areas from single images and total body component volumes in a large and diverse sample of healthy adult subjects. Total body {SM} and {AT} volumes were derived by whole body multislice magnetic resonance imaging in 123 men [age (mean +/- {SD}) of 41.6 +/- 15.8 yr; body mass index of 25.9 +/- 3.4 kg/m(2)] and 205 women (age of 47.8 +/- 18.7 yr; body mass index of 26.7 +/- 5.6 kg/m(2)). Single abdominal {SM} and {AT} slice areas were highly correlated with total body {SM} (r = 0.71-0.92; r = 0.90 at L(4)-L(5) intervertebral space) and {AT} (r = 0.84-0.96; r = 0.94 at L(4)-L(5) intervertebral space) volumes, respectively. R(2) increased by only 5.7-6.1\% for {SM} and 2.7-4.4\% for {AT} with the inclusion of subject sex, age, ethnicity, scanning position, body mass index, and waist circumference in the model. The developed {SM} and {AT} models were validated in an additional 49 subjects. To achieve equivalent power to a study measuring total body {SM} or {AT} volumes, a study using a single abdominal image would require 17-24\% more subjects for {SM} and 6-12\% more subjects for {AT}. Measurement of a single abdominal image can thus provide estimates of total body {SM} and {AT} for group studies of healthy adults.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that survival following surgery for colorectal cancer is poorer in the elderly. However, the findings were inconsistent and none of the studies adjusted for case mix. The aim of this study was to establish whether there were age-related differences in cancer (colorectal)-specific and non-cancer (colorectal)-related survival in patients undergoing elective potentially curative resection for Dukes stage A/B colorectal cancer. One thousand and forty three patients who underwent elective potentially curative resection for Dukes' A/B colorectal cancer between 1991 and 1994 in 11 hospitals  in Scotland were included in the study. Ten year cancer-specific and non-cancer-related survival and the hazard ratios were calculated according to age groups ({\textless}64; 65-74/{\textgreater}74 years). On follow-up 273 patients died of their cancer and 328 died of non-cancer-related causes. At 10 years, overall survival was 45\%, cancer specific was 70\% and non-cancer-related survival was 64\%. On multivariate  analysis of all factors, age ({HR} 1.38, 95\% {CI} 1.18-1.62, P{\textless}0.001), sex ({HR} 1.74,  95\% {CI} 1.36-2.23, P{\textless}0.001), site ({HR} 1.42, 95\% {CI} 1.11-1.81, P{\textless}0.01) and Dukes' stage ({HR} 1.71, 1.19-2.47, P{\textless}0.01) were independently associated with cancer-specific survival. On multivariate analysis of all factors, age ({HR} 2.14,  1.84-2.49, P{\textless}0.001), sex ({HR} 1.43, 1.15-1.79, P{\textless}0.01) and deprivation ({HR} 1.30, 1.09-1.55, P{\textless}0.01) were independently associated with non-cancer-related survival. The results of this study show that increasing age impacts negatively both on cancer-specific and non-cancer-related survival following elective potentially curative resection for node-negative colorectal cancer. However, the  effect of increasing age is greater on the non-cancer-related survival. These results suggest that cancer-specific and non-cancer-related mortality should be considered separately in survival analysis of these cancer patients.},

Recently, early drain removal has been recommended as a means of preventing {POPF}. The present study sought to determine how to distinguish clinical {POPF} from non-clinical {POPF} in the early postoperative period after {PD} to aid in early drain removal.
{METHODS}: From March 2002 through December 2010, 176 patients underwent {PD} and were enrolled in this study to examine factors predictive of clinical {POPF} after {PD}. {POPF} was defined and classified according to the International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery guideline, and grade B/C {POPF} was defined as clinical {POPF}.
{RESULTS}: Grade A {POPF} occurred in 39 (22.2 \%) patients, grade B in 19 (10.8 \%) patients, and grade C in 11 (6.3 \%) patients. Clinical {POPF} (grade B/C) occurred in 17.1 \% of patients. Multivariate analysis revealed male gender and body mass index ({BMI}) ≥22.5 kg/m(2) to be the independent preoperative risk factors predictive of {POPF}. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the combination of drain amylase ≥750 {IU}/L, C-reactive protein ({CRP}) ≥20 mg/{dL}, and body temperature ≥37.5 °C on postoperative day 3 could effectively distinguish clinical {POPF} from non-clinical {POPF}. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 84.6, 98.2, and 95.7 \%, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Male gender and {BMI} ≥22.5 were the independent preoperative predictive risk factors for {POPF}. We assume that when amylase is {\textless}750 {IU}/L, serum {CRP} is {\textless}20 mg/{dL}, and body temperature is {\textless}37.5 °C the drain can safely be removed, even if {POPF} is indicated.},

	abstract = {Background
Pancreatic fistula ({PF}) and delayed gastric emptying ({DGE}) are, respectively, the most frightening and most frequent complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy ({PD}). This study was undertaken to determine which independent factors influence the development of {PF} and {DGE} after {PD}.
Study Design
Between January 1996 and December 2005, 131 consecutive patients underwent a {PD} with pancreaticogastrostomy. A total of 22 items, entered prospectively, were examined with univariate and multivariate analysis. {PF} was defined as amylase-rich fluid collected by needle aspiration from an intraabdominal collection or from the drainage placed intraoperatively from day 3. {DGE} was defined as the need for nasogastric decompression beyond the 10th postoperative day.
Results
{PF} occurred in 14 patients (10.7\%), with a mean length of hospital stay of 40.1 ± 16.6 days. {DGE} occurred in 41 patients (31.3\%), with a mean length of hospital stay of 35.5 ± 13.6 days. {PF} and {DGE} increased postoperative length of stay. Multivariate analysis identified two independent factors for {PF}: heart disease as a risk factor and arterial hypertension as a protective factor. According to these two predictive factors, the observed rates of {PF} ranged from 4.1\% to 66.6\%. Age and early enteral feeding with nasojejunal tube were independent risk factors for {DGE}. {DGE} was statistically more frequent when surgical complications occurred or when an intraabdominal collection was present.
Conclusions
Heart disease was a risk factor and arterial hypertension was a protective factor of {PF}. Age and early enteral feeding were independent risk factors for {DGE}. {DGE} is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative intraabdominal complications.},

	abstract = {Renal failure complicating obstructive jaundice ({OJ}) is probably linked to reduction of the extracellular water compartment. To elucidate the mechanism by which {OJ} leads to isotonic water depletion we studied a group of rabbits with {OJ} after common bile duct ligation (n = 17) and another group of sham operated rabbits (n = 14) for 10 days. Water intake and balance for two study periods (1-4 and 7-10 days after operation) were calculated. Renal function, sodium balance and plasma atrial natriuretic factor were determined on the fourth and tenth days after operation. Water intake and balance were lower in the {OJ} group both in the first study period (230 versus 519 ml/days 1-4, P less than 0.001; and -2.4 versus 219 ml/days 1-4, P less than 0.0001 respectively) and in the second study period (260 versus 865 ml/days 7-10, P less than 0.0001; and 11 versus 379 ml/days 7-10, P less than 0.0001 respectively). Sodium intake was negligible in the {OJ} group both on day four (0.73 versus 7.15 {mM}/24 h, P less than 0.0001) and on day 10 (0.78 versus 15.78 {mM}/24 h, P less than 0.0001). As a result plasma osmolality did not change. Day 10 urine osmolality and osmolar clearance were reduced in the {OJ} group (653 versus 1103 {mOsm}/kg, P less than 0.0001 and 0.09 versus 0.25 ml/min, P less than 0.0001 respectively) together with a decreased creatinine clearance (3 versus 11 ml/min, P less than 0.0001). Atrial natriuretic factor was increased in jaundiced rabbits (day 4, 22.7 versus 7.5 fmol/ml, P less than 0.0001; and day 10, 26.5 versus 11.2 fmol/ml, P less than 0.02). These findings suggest that {OJ} leads to an isotonic volume depletion resulting from abnormalities of the extracellular volume regulating mechanisms. These appear to be secondary to an inappropriate elevation of the atrial natriuretic factor plasma concentration.},

	abstract = {Background—Although cardiac output ({CO}) plays the vital role of delivering nutrients to body tissues, few data are available concerning the relations of stroke volume ({SV}) and {CO} to body composition in large population samples.
Methods and Results—Doppler and 2D echocardiography and bioelectric impedance in 2744 Strong Heart Study participants were used to calculate {SV} and {CO} and to relate them to fat-free body mass ({FFM}), adipose mass, and demographic variables. Both {SV} and {CO} were higher in men than women and in overweight than normal-weight individuals, but these differences were diminished or even reversed by normalization for {FFM} or body surface area. In both sexes, {SV} and {CO} were more strongly related to {FFM} than adipose mass, other body habitus measures, arterial pressure, diabetes, or age. In multivariate analyses using the average of Doppler and left ventricular {SV} to minimize measurement variability, {FFM} was the strongest correlate of {SV} and {CO}; other independent correlates were adipose mass, systolic pressure, diabetes, age, and use of digoxin and calcium channel and β-blockers.
Conclusions—In a population-based sample, {SV} and {CO} are more strongly related to {FFM} than other variables; increased {FFM} may be the primary determinant of increased {SV} and {CO} in obesity.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To examine the effect of selective preoperative biliary drainage ({BD}) on perioperative resuscitation, morbidity, and mortality in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Biliary drainage prior to pancreaticoduodenectomy remains controversial. Proponents argue that it facilitates referral to high-volume tertiary centers, while detractors maintain that it increases surgical morbidity and mortality. {DESIGN}: Retrospective analysis of single-institution tumor registry database. {SETTING}: University medical center. {PATIENTS}: From October 1, 2003, to May 31, 2008, 90 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary mass lesions. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Clinicopathologic data were reviewed and analyzed among patients who did and did not receive {BD} for their association with perioperative outcomes. chi(2) Analysis, independent-samples t tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used as appropriate. {RESULTS}: Fifty-six patients (62\%) underwent {BD}, and 34 (38\%) did not. Intraoperative bile cultures were positive for 1 or more species of microorganisms in 88\% of stented patients (35 of 40). There were no significant differences in fluid requirements, transfusion requirements, or surgery duration between patients who did and did not undergo {BD}. Estimated blood loss was increased in patients who received {BD} (625 {mL} vs 525 {mL} in patients who did not undergo {BD}; P = .03), while reoperation was significantly more common in nonstented patients (4\% vs 15\% in patients who did not undergo {BD}; P = .02). Intensive care unit stay, overall length of stay, pancreatic leak/abscess/fistula, infectious complications, postoperative percutaneous drainage, hospital readmission, and 30- and 90-day mortality were not significantly different between the 2 groups. {CONCLUSIONS}: Although preoperative biliary stents may complicate the intraoperative management and lessen the postoperative complications of patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy, only estimated blood loss and reoperation were significantly different in this cohort. Further study may reveal patient subgroups who may specifically benefit or suffer from preoperative biliary stenting. Currently, selective preoperative {BD} appears appropriate in the multidisciplinary management of patients with periampullary lesions.},

Biopsy samples were examined by light and electron microscopy and correlated to serum liver functional tests recorded before and after biliary drainage. {RESULTS}: Pre-drainage biopsy presented diffuse morphological signs of congestion and cholestasis, lipid and bilirubin cytoplasm inclusions, loss of bile canaliculi microvilli and diffuse bile canaliculi dilatation. After-drainage biopsies presented reduction of bile canaliculi dilatation, partial restoring of bile canaliculi microvilli and persistence of diffuse hepatocyte structural and ultrastructural changes. Patients' laboratory values (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, {SGGT}, {SGOT} and {SGPT}), that were significantly impaired before drainage, returned almost to normal within two weeks after drainage. {CONCLUSION}: Preoperative biliary drainage in patients with long-standing obstructive jaundice has received wide yet controversial support due to a well established pathophysiological background.

	abstract = {Objectives:
Cachexia is common in pancreatic cancer and may have an influence on longterm survival but few studies have investigated this in patients with operable tumours. Therefore, this study was carried out to document body composition status in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma ({PCa}) presenting for a Whipple's procedure ({WP}) and to relate the findings to histopathology and longterm survival.

Methods:
Body composition was measured 1 day before a {WP} for ductal {PCa} in 36 patients (15 men, 21 women) aged 41–81 years. Results for total body nitrogen ({TBN}), nitrogen index ({NI}), total body water ({TBW}), fat mass ({FM}) and total body potassium ({TBK}) were compared with results in 73 age- and sex-matched controls. Patients' survival and details from histopathology synoptic reports were documented.

Results:
Patients undergoing {WPs} had low {TBK} values (P {\textless} 0.001) and females had lower body fat (P= 0.007) compared with controls. Five of 36 presented with significant protein deficiency, but this was not associated with a prolonged length of stay or reduced survival. The 12 patients who had involved surgical margins had larger tumours and reduced weight (P= 0.015), {FM} (P= 0.001), {TBN} (P= 0.045), {TBK} (P= 0.014) and survival (P= 0.036). However, multivariate Cox's regression analysis only included {FM} along with vascular invasion and margin status as independent predictors of survival.

Conclusions:
{PCa} patients undergoing a {WP} have reduced body fat and {TBK} compared with community controls while those with stage {III} tumours had greater deficits of fat, {TBK} and protein stores. However, preoperative body composition was a poor predictor of postoperative survival after pathological data were considered.},

The objective of this study was to investigate whether the preoperative hematologic markers, the platelet-lymphocyte ratio ({PLR}), or the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}) ratio are significant prognostic indicators in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
Methods
A total of 84 patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma over a 10-year period were identified from a retrospectively maintained database.
Results
The preoperative {NLR} was found to be a significant prognostic marker (P = .023), whereas {PLR} had no significant relationship with survival (P = .642) using univariate Cox survival analysis. The median overall survival in patients with an {NLR} of ≤3.0 (n = 55) was 13.7, 17.0 months in those with an {NLR} of 3.0 to 4.0 (n = 17) and 5.9 months in patients with a value of {\textgreater}4.0 (n = 12) (log rank, P = .016). The {NLR} retained its significance on multivariate analysis (P = .039) along with resection margin status (P = .001).

The mediators and tissues responsible for such apparent increased protein synthesis have not been clearly identified. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between protein synthetic rates in whole-body, skeletal muscle, and circulating cortisol concentrations in healthy subjects (n = 6) and cancer patients with evidence of an inflammatory response (n = 6). Protein synthetic rates were measured with a primed continuous 20-h infusion of [15N]glycine. Skeletal muscle was biopsied at laparotomy. Serum cortisol, resting energy expenditure, plasma proteins, nitrogen metabolites in urine, and skeletal muscle free amino acids were also measured. Derived whole-body and skeletal muscle protein synthetic rates in the cancer group were increased significantly (by 70 and 93\%, respectively, p {\textless} 0.05). Circulating concentrations of cortisol, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein were also significantly increased in the cancer group and indicated the presence of an inflammatory response. However, there was no significant increase in resting energy expenditure. Mechanisms by which apparent increases in whole-body and skeletal protein synthesis do not result in an increase in resting energy expenditure are discussed.

	abstract = {{AIM}: The aim of this manuscript is to review the current state of knowledge regarding C-reactive protein ({CRP}) kinetics after standard neurosurgical procedures, and to determine the value of {CRP} as a screening test for early post-operative infectious complications as opposed to other more commonly used tests, and as a marker of peri-operative surgical insult.
{METHODS}: Over 18 months period, {CRP} levels, alongside with {ESR} and {WCC} were assessed pre-operatively (at day 0) and post-operatively (at days 1,2,3,4 and 5) in 50 consecutive female patients and 50 consecutive male patients undergoing seven neurosurgical procedures. Each of the seven procedures involved a different level of intra-operative trauma. Factors of possible influences on {CRP}, including volume of blood transfused intra-operatively, type of anaesthetic administered, use of anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics levels were recorded.
{RESULTS}: The median age of our study population was 29.1 (mean ± {SD}: 28.4 ± 10.2; range: 20.4-53.8). Of the 100 patients recruited for our study, 13 developed post-operative infectious complications. In these patients, a secondary {CRP} rise or failure to decrease as expected had sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value of 100\%, 93.1\%, 100\% and 68.4\%, respectively, for detecting infectious complications. The mean post-operative {CRP} levels were highest in the most surgically traumatic procedure--lobotomy for epilepsy intervention, and lowest in the least surgically traumatic procedure--stereotactic brain biopsy (p {\textless} 0.001). Volume of blood transfused intra-operatively, type of anaesthetic administered, use of anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics levels did not affect {CRP} kinetics.
{CONCLUSION}: The results of this study suggest that {CRP} is a more reliable screening test for post-operative infectious complications in the practice of neurosurgery than other more commonly used tests ({WCC} and {ESR}). Furthermore, the results suggest that peak post-operative {CRP} levels mirrors the level of incurred intra-operative surgical insult.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The authors reviewed the hemorrhagic complications of patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomies between 1972 and 1996. {SUMMARY} {BACKGROUND} {DATA}: Although recent studies have demonstrated a reduction in the mortality of pancreatic resection, morbidity is still high. Bleeding is a close second to anastomotic dehiscence in the list of dangerous postoperative complications. {METHODS}: The medical records from a prospective data bank of 559 patients who underwent pancreatic resection at the Surgical Clinic of Mannheim (Heidelberg University) were analyzed in regard to postoperative hemorrhagic complications. Differences were evaluated with the Fisher exact test. {RESULTS}: The overall mortality rate was 2.7\%. Postoperative bleeding occurred in 42 patients (7.5\%), with 6 episodes ending fatally (14.3\%). Erosive bleeding after pancreatic leak was noted in 11 patients (26.2\%), 4 of whom died. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 22 patients, and operative field hemorrhage was present in 20 cases. Relaparotomy was necessary in 29 patients. An angiography with interventional embolization for recurrent bleeding was performed in three patients. Seven hemorrhages (4.6\%) occurred after pancreatectomy for chronic pancreatitis and 35 episodes of bleeding (8.6\%) were encountered after pancreatectomy for malignant disease. Obstructive jaundice was present in 359 patients (63.9\%). In this group of patients, 32 (8.9\%) postoperative hemorrhages occurred. Preoperative biliary drainage did not influence the type and mortality rate of postoperative hemorrhage in jaundiced patients. {CONCLUSION}: The prevention of these bleeding complications depends in the first place on meticulous hemostatic technique. Preoperative biliary drainage does not lower postoperative bleeding complications in jaundiced patients. Continuous, close observation of the patient in the postoperative period, so as to detect complications in time, and expeditious hemostasis are paramount.},

Twenty-one {PJ} leaks were identified, for a frequency of 16\% (21 of 131); 19\% (4 of 21) of these patients eventually died of {PJ} leak-related complications. A total of 23 items of perioperative data, presumed as risk factors predisposing to {PJ} leak, were examined. By univariate analysis, advanced age, prolonged duration of untreated jaundice, deep jaundice, decreased creatinine clearance, increased intraoperative blood loss, and shock during operation were statistically significant. However, by multivariate analysis, only duration of jaundice, creatinine clearance, and intraoperative blood loss turned out to be independent risk factors. Noteworthily, jaundiced patients with impaired creatinine clearance not only had a higher incidence of {PJ} leak, but were also more liable to experience sepsis and intraabdominal bleeding, which uniformly elicited a grave clinical course. Routine preoperative biliary drainage failed to enhance the security of {PJ}.

{DESIGN}: Inception cohort study of 48 surgical patients from preoperative status to postoperative day 7 and 9 healthy volunteers (controls).
{SETTING}: Large teaching hospital, Northern England.
{PATIENTS}: Monocyte {HLA}-{DR} and cytokine {mRNA} expression was determined in 32 of 48 consecutive patients undergoing elective major resectional surgery. Mononuclear cells for in vitro studies and serum samples for {IL}-10 measurement were obtained from the remaining 16 patients.

	abstract = {Introduction
An anaerobic threshold ({AT}) of {\textless}11ml/min/kg can identify patients at high risk of cardiopulmonary complications after major surgery. The aim of this study was to assess the value of cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) in predicting cardiopulmonary complications in high risk patients undergoing oesophagogastric cancer resection.

Methods
Between March 2008 and October 2010, 108 patients (83 men, 25 women) with a median age of 66 years (range: 38–84 years) underwent {CPET} before potentially curative resections for oesophagogastric cancers. Measured {CPET} variables included {AT} and maximum oxygen uptake at peak exercise ({VO}2 peak). Outcome measures were length of high dependency unit stay, length of hospital stay, unplanned intensive care unit ({ICU}) admission, and postoperative morbidity and mortality.

Results
The mean {AT} and {VO}2 peak were 10.8ml/min/kg (standard deviation [{SD}]: 2.8ml/min/kg, range: 4.6–19.3ml/min/kg) and 15.2ml/min/kg ({SD}: 5.3ml/min/kg, range: 5.4–33.3ml/min/kg) respectively; 57 patients (55\%) had an {AT} of {\textless}11ml/min/ kg and 26 (12\%) had an {AT} of {\textless}9ml/min/kg. Postoperative complications occurred in 57 patients (29 cardiopulmonary [28\%] and 28 non-cardiopulmonary [27\%]). Four patients (4\%) died in hospital and 21 (20\%) required an unplanned {ICU} admission. Cardiopulmonary complications occurred in 42\% of patients with an {AT} of {\textless}9ml/min/kg compared with 29\% of patients with an {AT} of ≥9ml/min/kg but {\textless}11ml/min/kg and 20\% of patients with an {AT} of ≥11ml/min/kg (p=0.04). There was a trend that those with an {AT} of {\textless}11ml/min/kg and a low {VO}2 peak had a higher rate of unplanned {ICU} admission.

Conclusions
This study has shown a correlation between {AT} and the development of cardiopulmonary complications although the discriminatory ability was low.},

The outcome measure was advanced neoplasia (cancer or intermediate or high risk adenomata). {RESULTS}: Of the 4188 individuals who underwent colonoscopy  following a positive occult blood stool test, colorectal pathology was present in 3043(73\%). Of the 3043 patients with colorectal pathology, 1704(56\%) had advanced neoplasia. Patients with advanced neoplasia were more likely to be older ({OR} 1.38; 95\% {CI} 1.19-1.59) and male ({OR} 1.66; 95\% {CI} 1.43-1.94) (both P{\textless}0.001).

This in turn creates a problem for studies on the enhanced removal that occurs in xenobiotic-induced hemolytic states; specifically, whether the enhanced removal should be considered as an increase in rate of the normal sequestration mechanism or as an unrelated process, in part or in whole. This difficulty bears directly on the interpretation of much of the mechanistic hemolytic literature. Because of its dual in vivo and in vitro hemolytic capability, and because of its capacity to induce frank lysis in the incubation mixture, phenylhydrazine has been used extensively as a model compound for mechanistic studies. These data have contributed heavily to our current concepts of how chemicals induce damage in the red cell.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula ({ISGPF}) classification scheme has become a useful system for characterizing the clinical impact of pancreatic fistula. We sought to identify predictive factors that predispose patients to fistula, specifically those with clinical relevance (grades B/C), and to describe the clinical and economic significance of risk stratification within this framework. {METHODS}: Overall, 233 consecutive pancreatoduodenectomies were performed between October 2001 and March 2007 in our institution. Pancreatic fistula is defined according to the {ISGPF} classification scheme. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for pancreatic fistula development. These features were then analyzed to determine whether additive risk severity equates to worsening clinical and economic impact. {RESULTS}: Fistulas of any extent occurred in 60 patients, but only 31 (14\%) were clinically relevant. There are no identifiable risk factors for grade A biochemical fistulas. Multivariate analysis shows that small pancreatic duct size ({\textless}3 mm); soft gland texture; ampullary, duodenal, cystic, or islet cell pathology; and increased intraoperative blood loss ({\textgreater}1,000 ml) are associated with clinically relevant fistulae. An additive effect is further illustrated, in which clinical and economic outcomes progressively worsen as risk profile increases. Each additional risk factor increases the odds of developing a clinically relevant fistula by 52\%. {CONCLUSIONS}: For pancreatoduodenectomy, small duct size; soft gland texture; ampullary, duodenal, cystic, or islet cell pathology; and increased intraoperative blood loss are convincing risk factors for the development clinically relevant fistulae as judged by {ISGPF} classification. As risk profile accrues, patients suffer more complications, encounter longer hospital stays, and incur greater hospital costs. These outcomes can be predicted in the operating room through accurate delineation of high-risk glands.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Established risk factors for the development of pancreatic cancer include tobacco use, family history of pancreatic cancer, personal history of diabetes, and obesity. The impact of risk factors on prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer, particularly obesity, has recently become controversial.
{METHODS}: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy between 1995 and 2009. Patients were categorized by body mass index ({BMI}) as normal (18.5-24.9 kg/m), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m), or obese (≥30 kg/m). Univariate analysis was performed to evaluate the association of obesity and other risk factors on overall survival.
{RESULTS}: Of the 355 patients evaluated, 149 (42.0\%) had normal {BMI}, 131 (36.9\%) were overweight, and 75 (21.1\%) were obese. Overall survival for normal, overweight, and obese groups was 17.3 months (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 14.2-20.8 months), 20.0 months (95\% {CI}, 16.6-23.6 months), and 22.1 months (95\% {CI}, 16.5-36.4 months), respectively (P = 0.58). Hazard ratios for tobacco use, family history of pancreatic cancer, and history of diabetes were 1.07, 1.38, and 0.87, respectively.

Vascular invasion is currently an independent prognostic factor in colorectal cancer influencing disease progression and survival. The vascular system consists of three components, arterial, venous and lymphatic vessels, all of which can be invaded but accurate  distinction between the components remains difficult with routine staining techniques. Even though higher detection rates with elastica staining, for large  vessel invasion, and recent techniques for immunohistochemistry for small vessel  invasion, have been reported, a standardised method of detection has not been agreed upon which is reflected in the variability of published results. As a result of the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme in the {UK} it will be necessary to  attempt to identify and stratify patients better, to be able to handle the stage  migration to early node negative colorectal cancer. At present up to a third of patients, with node-negative colorectal cancer on conventional histopathological  analysis, ultimately die of recurrent disease. It is therefore important to develop and standardised methods to identify lymphatic and blood vessel invasion  which will influence ultimate survival.

Patient demographics,  {WHO}/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, clinicopathological features and primary treatment modality were recorded. {RESULTS}: Details of 882 patients were collected prospectively. The majority of patients (87.3\%) had at least one comorbidity, the most common being weight loss (53\%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (43\%), renal impairment (28\%) and ischaemic heart disease (27\%). A composite score was produced that included both number and severity of comorbidities. One in seven patients (15.3\%) had severe comorbidity scores. There were statistically significant variations in comorbidity scores between treatment centres and between non-small cell lung carcinoma treatment groups. Disease stage was not associated with comorbidity score. {CONCLUSIONS}: There is a high prevalence of multiple, severe comorbidities in Scottish patients with lung cancer, and these vary by site and treatment group.

	abstract = {Cardiopulmonary exercise ({CPX}) testing has a number of medical applications, including the assessment of heart failure and the investigation of unexplained breathlessness. Over the past decade, it has become an important preoperative assessment tool to evaluate functional capacity and predict outcomes in patients undergoing both cardiac and noncardiac surgery. A {CPX} test is an incremental exercise test during which respiratory variables, including oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide excretion are measured and the {ECG} is monitored. Among the variables reported from a {CPX} test are oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold and peak oxygen uptake. A limited functional capacity as indicated by a low anaerobic threshold or {VO}(2peak) has been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of perioperative complications in a number of surgical settings. Other reported variables, including the ventilatory equivalents for oxygen ({VE}/{VO}(2)) and carbon dioxide ({VE}/{VCO}(2)) and the millilitre of oxygen delivered per heartbeat or oxygen pulse [{VO}(2)/heart rate ({HR})] may give indications as to the reasons for exercise limitation. {ECG} evidence of myocardial ischaemia with increasing workload is also an important indicator of increased perioperative risk. As a noninvasive, low-risk, test of the integrated responses to increasing cardiovascular stress, anaesthesiologists involved in preoperative assessment should have an understanding of its current uses and test outcomes. This review presents the physiological basis for {CPX} testing, methodology, advantages over other preoperative tests of cardiovascular function and guidance on the interpretation of {CPX} results in the perioperative setting.},

	abstract = {{AIM}: To elucidate the potential impact of the grade of complications on long-term survival of gastric cancer patients after curative surgery.
{METHODS}: A total of 751 gastric cancer patients who underwent curative gastrectomy between January 2002 and December 2006 in our center were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into four groups: no complications, Grade I, Grade {II} and Grade {III} complications, according to the following classification systems: T92 (Toronto 1992 or Clavien), Accordion Classification, and Revised Accordion Classification. Clinicopathological features were compared among the four groups and potential prognostic factors were analyzed. The Log-rank test was used to assess statistical differences between the groups. Independent prognostic factors were identified using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Stratified analysis was used to investigate the impact of complications of each grade on survival.
{RESULTS}: Significant differences were found among the four groups in age, sex, other diseases (including hypertension, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), body mass index ({BMI}), intraoperative blood loss, tumor location, extranodal metastasis, lymph node metastasis, tumor-node-metastasis ({TNM}) stage, and chemotherapy. Overall survival ({OS}) was significantly influenced by the complication grade. The 5-year {OS} rates were 43.0\%, 42.5\%, 25.5\% and 9.6\% for no complications, and Grade I, Grade {II} and Grade {III} complications, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001). Age, tumor size, intraoperative blood loss, lymph node metastasis, {TNM} stage and complication grade were independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. With stratified analysis, lymph node metastasis, tumor size, and intraoperative blood loss were independent prognostic factors for Grade I complications (P {\textless} 0.001, P = 0.031, P = 0.030). Age and lymph node metastasis were found to be independent prognostic factors for {OS} of gastric cancer patients with Grade {II} complications (P = 0.034, P = 0.001). Intraoperative blood loss, {TNM} stage, and chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors for {OS} of gastric cancer patients with Grade {III} complications (P = 0.003, P = 0.005, P {\textless} 0.001). There were significant differences among patients with Grade I, Grade {II} and Grade {III} complications in {TNM} stage {II} and {III} cancer (P {\textless} 0.001, P = 0.001).

In 2009, the {NHS} evidence adoption center and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ({NICE}) published a review of the use of endovascular aneurysm repair ({EVAR}) of abdominal aortic aneurysms ({AAAs}). They recommended the development of a risk-assessment tool to help identify {AAA} patients with greater or lesser risk of operative mortality and to contribute to mortality prediction., A low anaerobic threshold ({AT}), which is a reliable, objective measure of pre-operative cardiorespiratory fitness, as determined by pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) is associated with poor surgical outcomes for major abdominal surgery. We aimed to assess the impact of a {CPET}-based risk-stratification strategy upon perioperative mortality, length of stay and non-operative costs for elective (open and endovascular) infra-renal {AAA} patients.

Methods
A retrospective cohort study was undertaken. Pre-operative {CPET}-based selection for elective surgical intervention was introduced in 2007. An anonymized cohort of 230 consecutive infra-renal {AAA} patients (2007 to 2011) was studied. A historical control group of 128 consecutive infra-renal {AAA} patients (2003 to 2007) was identified for comparison., Comparative analysis of demographic and outcome data for {CPET}-pass ({AT} ≥ 11 ml/kg/min), {CPET}-fail ({AT} {\textless} 11 ml/kg/min) and {CPET}-submaximal (no {AT} generated) subgroups with control subjects was performed. Primary outcomes included 30-day mortality, survival and length of stay ({LOS}); secondary outcomes were non-operative inpatient costs.

Results
Of 230 subjects, 188 underwent {CPET}: {CPET}-pass n = 131, {CPET}-fail n = 35 and {CPET}-submaximal n = 22. When compared to the controls, {CPET}-pass patients exhibited reduced median total {LOS} (10 vs 13 days for open surgery, n = 74, P {\textless} 0.01 and 4 vs 6 days for {EVAR}, n = 29, P {\textless} 0.05), intensive therapy unit requirement (3 vs 4 days for open repair only, P {\textless} 0.001), non-operative costs (£5,387 vs £9,634 for open repair, P {\textless} 0.001) and perioperative mortality (2.7\% vs 12.6\% (odds ratio: 0.19) for open repair only, P {\textless} 0.05). {CPET}-stratified (open/endovascular) patients exhibited a mid-term survival benefit (P {\textless} 0.05).

Conclusion
In this retrospective cohort study, a pre-operative {AT} {\textgreater} 11 ml/kg/min was associated with reduced perioperative mortality (open cases only), {LOS}, survival and inpatient costs (open and endovascular repair) for elective infra-renal {AAA} surgery.},

The aim was to undertake the first systematic review of the use  of these models in gastro-oesophageal surgery patients. {METHODS}: An online database search was carried out from 1991 to December 2008. {RESULTS}: Twenty-two published studies in gastro-oesophageal cancer surgery were identified. Twelve studies were found not to address the above aim, leaving ten relevant publications for analysis. Pooled data from these studies showed the weighted observed-to-expected ratio (O/E) for postoperative mortality using {POSSUM} (n = 1189), P-{POSSUM} (n = 2314), and O-{POSSUM} (n = 1755) was 0.37, 0.83, and 0.51, respectively. The weighted O/E for morbidity using {POSSUM} (n = 1038) was 0.86. {CONCLUSION}: {POSSUM} and O-{POSSUM} most significantly overestimated postoperative mortality in gastro-oesophageal cancer patients. In contrast, P-{POSSUM} had the least overestimation and may be the most useful predictor of likely postoperative mortality in these patients.},

	abstract = {Contemporary treatment programs for patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer often involve preoperative therapy. When the duration of preoperative therapy exceeds 2 months, the risk of plastic endobiliary stent occlusion increases. Metal stents have much better patency but may complicate subsequent pancreaticoduodenectomy ({PD}). We evaluated rates of perioperative morbidity, mortality, and stent complications in 272 consecutive patients who underwent {PD} at our institution from May 2001 to November 2004. Of these 272 patients, 29 (11\%) underwent {PD} after placement of a metal stent, 141 underwent {PD} after placement of a plastic stent, 10 had {PD} after biliary bypass without stenting, and 92 had {PD} without any form of biliary decompression. No differences were found between the Metal Stent group and all other patients in median operative time, intraoperative blood loss, or length of hospital stay. No perioperative deaths occurred in the Metal Stent group versus 3 (1.2\%) deaths in the other 243 patients. The incidence of major perioperative complications was similar between the two groups, including the rates of pancreatic fistula, intra-abdominal abscess, and wound infection. Furthermore, there were no differences in the perioperative morbidity or mortality rates between patients who underwent preoperative biliary decompression with a stent of any kind (metal or plastic) and those patients who underwent no biliary decompression at all. Metal stent-related complications occurred in 2 (7\%) of 29 patients during a median preoperative interval of 4.1 months; in contrast, 75 (45\%) of the 166 patients who had had plastic stents experienced complications, including 98 stent occlusions, during a median preoperative interval of 3.9 months (P {\textless} 0.001). We conclude that the use of expandable metal stents does not increase {PD}-associated perioperative morbidity or mortality, and as such an expandable metal stent is our preferred method of biliary decompression in patients with symptomatic malignant distal bile duct obstruction in whom surgery is not anticipated, or in whom there is a significant delay in the time to surgery.},

The accuracy study in vitro used (1) mixtures of water and alcohol, (2) mixtures of ox muscle and lard, and (3) dried bones. In the clinically relevant range of values there were only small influences on {DEXA} measurements of variations in amount and composition of the soft tissue equivalents. The accuracy study in vivo compared the components of body composition measured recently by {DEXA} and earlier by dual photon absorptiometry, counting of naturally occurring total body 40K, and body density by underwater weighing in 25 healthy adult subjects. We found agreement between fat percentage (and lean body mass) by {DEXA} and the three established measurements modalities; mean differences were (-5·3 to -0·4\%) and (-0·7 to 2·5 kg) for fat percentage and lean body mass, respectively. We conclude that {DEXA} provides a new method of measuring body composition with precision and accuracy errors, which are compatible with the application of {DEXA} in group research studies and probably also in clinical measurements of the single subject.},

A total of 225 healthy obese women 18-65 years ({BMI}{\textgreater} or=30 kg/m(2)) and 81 non-athletic lean women ({BMI}{\textless} or=26 kg/m(2)) were selected. Anthropometric measurements (weight and height), body composition assessment (bioelectrical impedance method) and a maximal exercise capacity test on a bicycle ergometer were performed. Oxygen uptake ({VO}(2)), carbon dioxide production ({VCO}(2)), expired ventilation ({VE}), respiratory quotient ({RQ}), breathing efficiency ({VE}/{VO}(2)), mechanical efficiency ({ME}) and anaerobic threshold ({AT}) were calculated. At a submaximal intensity load of 70 W, {VO}(2) (l/min) was larger in the obese women and was already 78\% of their peak {VO}(2), whereas in the non-obese it was only 69\% (P=0.0001). {VE} (l/min) was larger, {VE}/{VO}(2) did not differ and {ME} was lower in obese compared to the lean women. {AT} occurred at the same percentage of peak {VO}(2) in both lean and obese women. At peak effort, achieved load, terminal {VO}(2) (l min(-1) kg(-1)), {VE}, heart rate, {RQ} respiratory exchange ratio and perceived exertion were lower in obese subjects compared to the non-obese. Obese subjects mentioned significantly more musculoskeletal pain as a reason to end the test, whereas in lean subjects it was leg fatigue. Lean women recovered better as after 2 min they were already at 35\% of the peak {VO}(2), whereas in the obese women it was 47\% (P=0.0001). Our results confirm that exercise capacity is decreased in obesity, both at submaximal and peak intensity, and during recovery. Moreover, at peak effort musculoskeletal pain was an important reason to end the test and not true leg fatigue. These findings are important when designing exercise programs for obese subjects.},

To determine the benefit of surgery for resectable pancreatic adenocarcinomas ({PAs}) in elderly patients.
Methods
From 2004 to 2009, 932 patients with resectable {PAs} underwent pancreatectomies without neoadjuvant treatment in 37 institutions. The patients were divided into three groups according to age: \&lt;70 years (control group; n = 580); 70–79 years (70s group, n = 288), and ≥80 years (80s group; n = 64). Preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative, and histological data were recorded to assess the postoperative course and survival.
Results
Preoperative or intraoperative characteristics, and the histological findings were comparable in the three groups. Postoperative mortality and morbidity rates did not differ in the three groups. Adjuvant therapies were more frequently used in younger patients than in elderly patients (p \&lt; 0.01). The overall 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates of control group/70's group/80's group were 82.2\%/75.7\%/75.7\%, 49.9\%/41.8\%/31\%, and 38.7\%/33.2\%/0\%, respectively (p = 0.16). The median survival of the control, 70s, and 80s groups was 24 months, 35.3 months, and 30 months, respectively. Four independent prognostic indicators were identified by multivariate analysis: venous invasion (hazard ratio ({HR}) = 2.12), arterial invasion ({HR} = 2.96), positive lymph nodes ({HR} = 2.25), and adjuvant treatment ({HR} = 0.65).
Conclusions
Fit elderly patients with resectable {PAs} should not be excluded from surgical resection of {PA} solely because of their real age. Moreover, elderly patients seem to obtain similar advantages from pancreatectomies than younger patients.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that, as part of the inflammatory response to the presence  of a tumor, various cytokines are produced and these induce hepatic synthesis of  acute-phase proteins ({APP}). Under these circumstances it is not known what changes occur in the fixed component of hepatic protein synthesis. The aim of this study was to compare circulating interleukin-1 ({IL}-1), interleukin-6 ({IL}-6), and tumor necrosis factor ({TNF}) concentrations and fixed hepatic protein synthesis rates in a group of healthy controls (n = 6) with a group of patients with an established {APP} response secondary to hepatic metastasis from colorectal  cancer (n = 6). Fixed hepatic protein synthesis rates were measured following a primed, constant 20-hour infusion of 15N-glycine. The liver was biopsied at laparotomy. The {APP} response was assessed by serum C-reactive protein concentration and cytokines were assayed by a combination of immunoassay and bioassay. The patients with advanced cancer and an on-going {APP} response had elevated circulating {IL}-6 concentrations (p less than 0.01). Rates of fixed hepatic protein synthesis were 30\% lower than those observed in controls (p less  than 0.01). These findings demonstrate that in patients with hepatic metastasis,  although the synthesis of certain acute-phase export proteins can be increased, fixed protein synthesis is reduced. Whether these changes in the distribution of  hepatic protein synthesis are mediated by {IL}-6 will require further investigation.},

	abstract = {We investigated a possible beneficial role for bilirubin, one of the products of heme degradation by the cytoprotective enzyme heme oxygenase-1 in counteracting Escherichia coli endotoxin-mediated toxicity. Homozygous jaundice Gunn rats, which display high plasma bilirubin levels due to deficiency of glucuronyl transferase activity, and Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to sustained exogenous bilirubin administration were more resistant to endotoxin ({LPS})-induced hypotension and death compared with nonhyperbilirubinemic rats. {LPS}-stimulated production of nitric oxide ({NO}) was significantly decreased in hyperbilirubinemic rats compared with normal animals; this effect was associated with reduction of inducible {NO} synthase ({NOS}2) expression in renal, myocardial, and aortic tissues. Furthermore, {NOS}2 protein expression and activity were reduced in murine macrophages stimulated with {LPS} and preincubated with bilirubin at concentrations similar to that found in the serum of hyperbilirubinemic animals. This effect was secondary to inhibition of {NAD}(P)H oxidase since 1) inhibition of {NAD}(P)H oxidase attenuated {NOS}2 induction by {LPS}, 2) bilirubin decreased {NAD}(P)H oxidase activity in vivo and in vitro, and 3) down-regulation of {NOS}2 by bilirubin was reversed by addition of {NAD}(P)H. These findings indicate that bilirubin can act as an effective agent to reduce mortality and counteract hypotension elicited by endotoxin through mechanisms involving a decreased {NOS}2 induction secondary to inhibition of {NAD}(P)H oxidase.},

We have since increased our understanding of pancreatitis, and the nomenclature has changed to define disease in which necrosis becomes organized (called "walled-off"). Endoscopic approaches to evaluate and treat pancreatitis have progressed from making small transmural tracts for irrigation to making large tracts, which allow the endoscope to move directly into necrotic cavities and perform endoscopic necrosectomy. The purpose of endoscopic debridement is to irrigate and/or remove areas of necrosis. Collaboration between therapeutic endoscopists and interventional radiologists has led to a combined approach to organized pancreatic necrosis.

{DESIGN}: Retrospective review and statistical analysis using prospectively collected data.
{SETTING}: Referral center with a dedicated multidisciplinary pancreas cancer program.
{PATIENTS}: Two hundred eighty-five consecutive patients with data available for {BMI} calculation who underwent potentially curative pancreas resection to treat adenocarcinoma from January 1, 1999, to October 31, 2006.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURE}: Influence of {BMI} and other known prognostic variables on the incidence of lymph node metastasis and disease-free and overall survival.
{RESULTS}: We identified a subset of obese patients ({BMI} {\textgreater}35) who were at 12-fold risk of lymph node metastasis compared with nonobese patients ({BMI} {\textless} or =35). The estimated disease-free and overall survival rates were decreased in the obese patients, and the risk of cancer recurrence and death after pancreatectomy was nearly twice that in nonobese patients.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Obese patients with a {BMI} of more than 35 are more likely to have node-positive pancreatic cancer and decreased survival after surgical resection. Data suggest that the negative influence of {BMI} of more than 35 on cancer-related end points is unrelated to the potential complexity of performing major oncologic surgery in obese patients.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Screening programs and greater public awareness have increased the recognition of early abdominal aortic aneurysm ({AAA}) disease. No medical therapy has proven effective in limiting {AAA} progression, and little is known regarding the safety and efficacy of exercise training in these patients. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of up to 3 yr of training in patients with early (≤5.5 cm) {AAA} disease.
{METHODS}: One hundred and forty patients with small {AAAs} (72 ± 8 yr) were randomized to exercise training (n = 72) or usual care (n = 68). Exercise subjects participated in a combination of in-house and home training for up to 3 yr. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPX}) was performed at baseline and 3, 12, 24, and 36 months. Comparisons were made for {AAA} expansion, safety, {CPX} responses, and weekly energy expenditure.
{RESULTS}: The average duration of participation was 23.4 ± 9.6 months; 81\% of subjects completed ≥1 year. No adverse clinical events or excessive {AAA} growth rates related to training occurred. Exercise subjects expended a mean 1999 ± 1030 kcal·wk. Increases in peak exercise time and estimated {METs} occurred at the 3-month and 1-, 2-, and 3-yr evaluations (P {\textless} 0.01 between groups). A significant between-group interaction occurred for V˙O2 at the ventilatory threshold (P = 0.02), and submaximal heart rate was significantly reduced among exercise subjects. Neither exercise status nor level of fitness significantly influenced rate of {AAA} enlargement.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These results support the safety and efficacy of training in patients with small {AAA}, a population for which few previous data are available. Despite advanced age and comorbidities, training up to 3 yr was well tolerated and sustainable in {AAA} patients. Training did not influence rate of {AAA} enlargement.},

However, the cause of the pain and the clinicopathologic features of patients with pain have not been fully elucidated. We retrospectively determined the factors related to preoperative abdominal and/or back pain in 95 patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic tumor size, invasion of the intrapancreatic nerves, invasion of the anterior pancreatic capsule, and lymph node metastasis were determined to be variables related to the pain. Pancreatic tumor size, invasion of anterior pancreatic capsule, and lymph node metastasis were also variables significantly correlating to pain intensity. Survival also correlated with pain intensity: the median survival periods were 29 months in patients without pain, 19 months in those with mild pain, and 9 months in those with severe pain who required analgesics. Larger pancreatic tumors, invasion of the intrapancreatic nerves, and invasion of the anterior pancreatic capsule may cause abdominal and/or back pain in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. This study also suggests clinical implications of the pain intensity as a prognostic factor in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer.},

However the time period from biliary occlusion to the occurrence of the dysfunction has not been determined decisively. {PURPOSE}: To evaluate the early effects (1 d and 7 d) of {OJ} on liver mitochondria respiratory function in rats. {METHODS}: Male Wistar rats (200-250 g) were randomly divided into the following 3 groups: laparotomy plus {OJ} for 24 h (1d group) (n = 10); laparotomy plus {OJ} for 7 d (7d group) (n = 10); sham control procedure ({CTR} group) (n = 12). At the end of {OJ} periods, total serum bilirubin level, hepatic enzyme activity levels ({GOT}, {GTP}, Gama-{GT}, {ALP}), mitochondrial respiration phases S3 and S4, as well as the respiratory control ratio ({RC} = S3/S4), and {ADP} consumption/oxygen consumption ({ADP}/O) ratio, were determined. {RESULTS}: Total serum bilirubin, activity of most hepatic enzymes, and O2 consumption during basal (S4) respiration were increased in the 1d and 7d groups ({ANOVA}, p = 0.05 vs. {CTR}). After {ADP} addition, the O2 consumption rate (S3) in the 1d group remained similar to the {CTR} rate ({ANOVA} p {\textgreater} .05), while the {RC} rate was reduced ({ANOVA}, p = 0.001) vs. {CTR}. The effects observed on mitochondrial respiration in the 1d group were exacerbated in the 7d group. {CONCLUSION}: These results indicate that {OJ} induces early (24 h) depression of liver mitochondria respiration, and thus may lead to early reduction in the production of high energy bonds.},

	abstract = {Although both capillary density and peak oxygen consumption (Vo(2)) improve with exercise training, it is difficult to find a relationship between these two measures. It has been suggested that peak Vo(2) may be more related to central hemodynamics than to the oxidative potential of skeletal muscle, which may account for this observation. We hypothesized that change in a measure of submaximal performance, anaerobic threshold, might be related to change in skeletal muscle capillary density, a marker of oxidative potential in muscle, with training. Due to baseline differences among these variables, we also hypothesized that relationships might be sex specific. A group of 21 subjects completed an inactive control period, whereas 28 subjects (17 men and 11 women) participated in a 6-mo high-intensity exercise program. All subjects were sedentary, overweight, and dyslipidemic. Potential relationships were assessed between change in capillary density with both change in Vo(2) at peak and at anaerobic threshold with exercise training. All variables and relationships were assessed for sex-specific effects. Change in peak Vo(2) was not related to change in capillary density after exercise training in either sex. Men had a positive correlation between change in Vo(2) at anaerobic threshold and change in capillary density with exercise training (r = 0.635; P {\textless} 0.01), whereas women had an inverse relationship (r = -0.636; P {\textless} 0.05) between the change in these variables. These findings suggest that, although enhanced capillary density is associated with training-induced improvements in submaximal performance in men, this relationship is different in women.},

For this reason, preoperative percutaneous transhepatic drainage ({PTD}) has been recommended for these patients. This method of management, however, has only been supported by retrospective and nonrandomized studies. Therefore, a prospective, randomized study was performed to determine the effect of preoperative {PTD} on operative mortality, morbidity, hospital stay, and hospital cost. Thirty-day mortality was 8.1\% among 37 patients undergoing preoperative {PTD}, compared to 5.3\% for 38 patients who went to surgery without preoperative drainage. Overall morbidity was also slightly, but not significantly, higher in patients who underwent preoperative {PTD}, (57\% versus 53\%). However, total hospital stay was significantly longer (p less than 0.005) in the {PTD} group (31.4 days versus 23.1 days). The cost of this excess hospitalization and the {PTD} procedure at our university medical center was over +8000 per patient. The authors conclude that preoperative {PTD} does not reduce operative risk but does increase hospital cost and, therefore, should not be performed routinely.},

The five year survival rate for patients without tumor extension beyond the pancreas was 25 percent (confidence limits, 5 to 50 percent), and in patients with adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater, 34 percent (confidence limits, 3 to 65 percent). The median survival rate in patients with adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater was 3.3 years, which was significantly longer than in the other patients. Fifty-nine patients with distant spread could be divided into 14 patients with para-aortic lymph node metastases who had a significantly shorter survival period than 45 patients without para-aortic lymph node metastases (p = 0.004). Most patients surviving more than one year were doing well, although 60 percent needed exocrine pancreatic substitution therapy. {CONCLUSIONS}: Resection of periampullary carcinoma provides a better palliation and survival rate than nonoperative biliary drainage or bypass operation. An improved preoperative verification of para-aortic metastases could restrict resection to patients with a prognostic five year survival rate of more than 25 percent and a postoperative mortality rate of less than 5 percent.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Pancreatogenic diabetes after pancreatectomy is of growing importance due to the increasing life expectancy of pancreatectomized patients. Although reduction of pancreatic volume is thought to affect glucose metabolism, a consistent relationship has yet to be determined. This study aimed to investigate functional consequences of distal pancreatectomy ({DP}) in preoperatively non-diabetic patients.

Methods
This study included 61 non-diabetic patients who underwent {DP}. Clinical data were obtained, and the percent resected volume ({PRV}) of each pancreas was determined via multi-detector row computed tomography volumetry.

Results
During the follow-up period (median 26 months), 22 patients (36 \%) developed new-onset diabetes within a median onset time of 8 months (range 0.5–42 months) postoperatively. The remaining 39 patients also showed impaired glucose metabolism. Multivariate analysis identified preoperative hemoglobin A1c ≥ 5.7 \% (odds ratio 15.6, p = 0.001) and {PRV} {\textgreater} 44 \% (odds ratio 11.3, p = 0.004) as independent risk factors for new-onset diabetes.

Conclusions
Key determinants of postoperative glycemic control include preoperative functional reserve of the endocrine pancreas and the volume reduction of pancreatic parenchyma. Our findings enable reliable preoperative evaluation of the risk of postoperative diabetes and appropriate postoperative surveillance, which is helpful for early intervention in high risk patients.},

Better pre-operative risk stratification may improve patient selection for pancreatic resection in pancreatic cancer. C-reactive protein ({CRP}) and the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}) have demonstrated prognostic value in some cancers. The role of {CRP} and {NLR} in predicting outcome in pancreatic cancer after curative resection is not well established.


Methods

An electronic search of {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE} and {CINAHL} was performed to identify studies assessing survival in patients after pancreatic cancer resection with high or low pre-operative {CRP} or {NLR}. Systematic review was undertaken using the {PRISMA} protocol.


Results

In total, 327 studies were identified with 10 reporting on survival outcomes after a pancreatic resection in patients with high or low {CRP}, {NLR} or both. All but one paper showed a trend of lower inflammatory markers in patients with longer survival. Three studies from six showed low {CRP} to be independently associated with increased survival and two studies of eight showed the same for {NLR}. All studies were retrospective cohort studies of low to moderate quality.


Discussion

Inflammatory markers might prove useful guides to the management of resectable pancreatic cancer but, given the poor quality of evidence, further longitudinal studies are required before incorporating pre-operative inflammatory markers into clinical decision making.},

	abstract = {Background
Preoperative anaemia and low exertional oxygen uptake are both associated with greater postoperative morbidity and mortality. This study reports the association among haemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), peak oxygen uptake (V˙O2 peak) and anaerobic threshold ({AT}) in elective surgical patients.

Methods
Between 1999 and 2011, preoperative [Hb] and cardiopulmonary exercise tests were recorded in 1,777 preoperative patients in four hospitals. The associations between [Hb], V˙O2 peak and {AT} were analysed by linear regression and covariance.

Results
In 436 (24.5\%) patients, [Hb] was {\textless}12 g dl-1 and, in 83 of these, {\textless}10 g dl-1. Both {AT} and V˙O2 peak rose modestly with increasing [Hb] (r2 = 0.24, P {\textless}0.0001 and r2 = 0.30, P {\textless}0.0001, respectively). After covariate adjustment, an increase in [Hb] of one standard deviation was associated with a 6.7 to 9.7\% increase in V˙O2 peak, and a rise of 4.4 to 6.0\% in {AT}. Haemoglobin concentration accounted for 9\% and 6\% of the variation in V˙O2 peak and {AT} respectively.

Conclusions
To a modest extent, lower haemoglobin concentrations are independently associated with lower oxygen uptake during preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing. It is unknown whether this association is causative.},

The aim of the present study was to compare a rapid acid-ethanol  precipitation ({AEP}) method of measuring bound leptin with the more laborious gel  exclusion chromatography ({GEC}) reference procedure. Serum samples collected from  healthy subjects and cancer patients were used in this comparison. {METHODS}: {AEP} and {GEC} methods for measuring leptin binding in serum (from 14 healthy volunteers and 14 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer) were adapted from previously published procedures. {RESULTS}: Intra- and inter-assay precision of the {AEP} method were 6\% (n = 10) and 8\% (n = 10), respectively. Bland-Altman analysis  of results obtained from the {AEP} and {GEC} methods indicated no significant difference in healthy controls. However, significantly higher results were obtained by the {AEP} method in the cancer patients. {CONCLUSIONS}: Evaluation of the {AEP} method revealed that on examination of normal subjects the method was less precise than had previously been reported. Moreover, the method gave differing results in the cancer patients when compared with the {GEC} method. This study indicates that careful evaluation of any new method for measuring leptin binding  requires comparison with a {GEC} method using the sample matrix of interest.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Cardiorespiratory fitness is currently estimated by dividing maximal oxygen consumption ({VO}(2max)) by body weight (per-weight standard). However, the statistically correct way to neutralize the effect of weight on {VO}(2max) in a given population is adjustment for body weight by regression techniques (adjusted standard). Our objective is to quantify the bias introduced by the per-weight standard in a population distributed across different categories of body mass.
{DESIGN}: This is a cross-sectional study.
{SUBJECTS} {AND} {METHODS}: Baseline measures from participants of the Dose-Responses to Exercise Training Study ({DR}'s {EXTRA}), 635 men (body mass index ({BMI}): 19-47 kg m⁻²) and 638 women ({BMI}: 16-49 kg m⁻²) aged 57-78 years who performed oral glucose tolerance tests and maximal exercise stress tests with direct measurement of {VO}(2max). We compare the increase in {VO}(2max) implied by the per-weight standard with the real increase of {VO}(2max) per kg body weight. A linear logistic regression model estimates odds for abnormal glucose metabolism (either impaired fasting glycemia or impaired glucose tolerance or Type 2 diabetes) of the least-fit versus most-fit quartile according to both per-weight standard and adjusted standard.
{RESULTS}: The per-weight standard implies an increase of {VO}(2max) with 20.9 ml min⁻¹ in women and 26.4 ml min⁻¹ in men per additional kg body weight. The true increase per kg is only 7.0 ml min⁻¹ (95\% confidence interval: 5.3-8.8) and 8.0 ml min⁻¹ (95\% confidence interval: 5.3-10.7), respectively. Risk for abnormal glucose metabolism in the least-fit quartile of the population is overestimated by 52\% if the per-weight standard is used.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In comparisons across different categories of body mass, the per-weight standard systematically underestimates cardiorespiratory fitness in obese subjects. Use of the per-weight standard markedly inflates associations between poor fitness and co-morbidities of obesity.},

Gemcitabine-based chemotherapy was administered in 183 patients and was well tolerated in both elderly group and in those with comorbidities. In a multivariate analysis, {CCI}, not age, was prognostic in addition to {PS}, distant metastasis, chemotherapy and {CA}19-9: the hazard ratios of {CCI} 1 and ≥2 were 1.25 and 1.55, compared with {CCI} 0 (p = 0.027).
Conclusions
Gemcitabine-based chemotherapy can be an effective treatment, without significant toxicity, in elderly patients. Comorbidity, not age, was prognostic in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Between 4\% and 13\% of patients with operable pancreatic malignancy are found unresectable at the time of surgery. Double bypass is a good option for fit patients but it is associated with a high risk of postoperative complications. The aim of this study was to identify pre-operatively which patients undergoing double bypass are at high risk of complications and to assess their long-term outcome.
{METHODS}: Of the 576 patients undergoing pancreatic resections between 2006 and 2011, 50 patients who underwent a laparotomy for a planned pancreaticoduodenectomy had a double bypass procedure for inoperable disease. Demographic data, risk factors for postoperative complications and pre-operative anaesthetic assessment data including the Portsmouth Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the {enUmeration} of Mortality and morbidity (P-{POSSUM}) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) were collected.
{RESULTS}: Fifty patients (33 men and 17 women) were included in the study. The median patient age was 64 years (range: 39-79 years). The complication rate was 50\% and the in-hospital mortality rate was 4\%. The P-{POSSUM} physiology subscore and low anaerobic threshold at {CPET} were significantly associated with postoperative complications (p =0.005 and p =0.016 respectively) but they were unable to predict them. Overall long-term survival was significantly shorter in patients with postoperative complications (9 vs 18 months). Postoperative complications were independently associated with poorer long-term survival (p =0.003, odds ratio: 3.261).
{CONCLUSIONS}: P-{POSSUM} and {CPET} are associated with postoperative complications but the possibility of using them for risk prediction requires further research. However, postoperative complications following double bypass have a significant impact on long-term survival and this type of surgery should therefore only be performed in specialised centres.},

	issn = {0022-5282},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To examine the relationship between circulating interleukin-10 ({IL}-10) and the occurrence of lymphocyte apoptosis after surgical/anesthesia trauma.
{METHODS}: Data were collected prospectively on 18 adult patients undergoing elective major surgery. Blood sampling for assessment of lymphocyte apoptosis and {IL}-10 levels was performed on the day before surgery (t(0)) and at 24 and 96 hours after operation (t(1) and t(2), respectively). After lymphocyte isolation, quantification of apoptosis was made by staining apoptotic cells with 7-amino-actinomycin D. Plasma {IL}-10 concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
{RESULTS}: A significantly increased frequency of apoptotic {CD}4(+) and {CD}8(+) cells (p {\textless} 0.05) was observed at t1 measurement (8.10\% +/- 0.58\% and 12.21\% +/- 1.47\% for {CD}4(+) and {CD}8(+), respectively) compared with preoperative values (1.53\% +/- 0.38\% and 1.32\% +/- 0.45\% for {CD}4(+) and {CD}8(+), respectively). Plasma {IL}-10 levels showed a significant elevation at both t(1) and t(2) times, peaking at t(1). At t(1), {IL}-10 levels were correlated with the frequency of {CD}4(+) and {CD}8(+) apoptotic lymphocytes (r = 0.78, p = 0.0005 for {IL}-10 vs. apoptotic {CD}4(+); r = 0.71, p = 0.003 for {IL}-10 vs. apoptotic {CD}8(+)).
{CONCLUSION}: Surgical trauma is associated with a significant but transient increase in lymphocyte commitment to apoptosis and {IL}-10 production. The exact relationship linking the overproduction of {IL}-10 with lymphocyte apoptosis after a surgical operation is still elusive and requires further investigation.},

	doi = {10.3109/10408440903222177},
	abstract = {Trichloroethylene ({TCE}) is a widespread environmental contaminant that is carcinogenic when given in high, chronic doses to certain strains of mice and rats. The capacity of {TCE} to cause cancer in humans is less clear. The current maximum contaminant level ({MCL}) of 5 ppb (microg/L) is based on an {US} Environment Protection Agency ({USEPA}) policy decision rather than the underlying science. In  view of major advances in understanding the etiology and mechanisms of chemically induced cancer, {USEPA} began in the late 1990s to revise its guidelines for cancer risk assessment. {TCE} was chosen as the pilot chemical. The {USEPA} (2005) final guidelines emphasized a "weight-of-evidence" approach with consideration of dose-response relationships, modes of action, and metabolic/toxicokinetic processes. Where adequate data are available to support reversible binding of the carcinogenic moiety to biological receptors as the initiating event (i.e., a threshold exists), a nonlinear approach is to be used. Otherwise, the default assumption of a linear (i.e., nonthreshold) dose-response is utilized. When validated physiologically based pharmacokinetic ({PBPK}) models are available, they are to be used to predict internal dosimetry as the basis for species and dose extrapolations. The present article reviews pertinent literature and discusses areas where research may resolve some outstanding issues and facilitate the reassessment process. Key research needs are proposed, including role of dichloroacetic acid ({DCA}) in {TCE}-induced liver tumorigenesis in humans; extension of current {PBPK} models to predict target organ deposition of trichloroacetic acid ({TCA}) and {DCA} in humans ingesting {TCE} in drinking water; use of human hepatocytes to ascertain metabolic rate constants for use in {PBPK} models that incorporate variability in metabolism of {TCE} by potentially sensitive subpopulations; measurement of the efficiency of first-pass elimination of trace levels of {TCE} in drinking water; and assessment of exogenous factors' (e.g., alcohol, drugs) ability to alter metabolic activation and risks at such low-level exposure.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Aortic aneurysm repair is a high-risk surgical procedure. Patients are often elderly, with multiple comorbidities that predispose them to perioperative morbidity. Use of endovascular aneurysm repair ({EVAR}) has increased due to reduced early perioperative risk. This study assessed whether preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) could be used to predict morbidity and hospital length of stay ({LOS}) after aortic aneurysm repair.
{METHODS}: A total of 185 patients underwent surgical repair (84 open repairs, 101 {EVAR}) and had adequate determination of a submaximal {CPET} parameter (anaerobic threshold).
{RESULTS}: Patient comorbidities and cardiorespiratory fitness, derived from {CPET}, were similar between surgical procedures. Patients undergoing {EVAR} had fewer complications (10\% vs 32\%; P{\textless}.0001) and shorter mean (standard deviation [{SD}]) hospital {LOS} of 5.7 (9.3) days vs 14.4 (10.9) days compared with open repair (P{\textless}.0001). The hospital {LOS} was significantly increased in patients with one or more complications in both groups compared with those with no complications. In the open repair group, the level of fitness, as defined by anaerobic threshold, was an independent predictor of postoperative morbidity and hospital {LOS}. When the optimal anaerobic threshold (10 {mL}/min/kg) derived from receiver operator curve analysis was used as a cutoff value, unfit patients stayed significantly longer than fit patients in critical care (mean, 6.4 [{SD}, 6.9] days vs 2.4 [{SD}, 2.9] days; P=.002) and in the hospital (mean, 23.1 [{SD}, 14.8] days vs 11.0 [{SD}, 6.1] days; P{\textless}.0001). In contrast, fitness in the {EVAR} group was not predictive of postoperative morbidity but did have predictive value for hospital {LOS}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Cardiorespiratory fitness holds significant clinical value before aortic aneurysm repair in predicting postsurgical complications and duration of critical care and hospital {LOS}. Preoperative measurement of fitness could then direct clinical management with regard to operative choice, postoperative resource allocation, and informed patient decision making.},

	abstract = {There is increasing and consistent evidence that cancer-associated inflammation is a key determinant of outcome in patients with cancer. Various markers of inflammation have been examined over the past decade in an attempt to refine stratification of patients to treatment and predict survival. One routinely available marker of the systemic inflammatory response is the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}), which is derived from the absolute neutrophil  and absolute lymphocyte counts of a full blood count. To date, over 60 studies ({\textgreater}37,000 patients) have examined the clinical utility of the {NLR} to predict patient outcomes in a variety of cancers. The present systematic review examines  and comments on the clinical utility of the {NLR}. The {NLR} had independent prognostic value in (a) unselected cohorts (1 study of {\textgreater}12,000 patients), (b) operable disease (20 studies, {\textgreater}4000 patients), (c) patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment and resection (5 studies, {\textgreater}1000 patients), (d) patients receiving chemo/radiotherapy (12 studies, {\textgreater}2000 patients) and (e) patients with inoperable  disease (6 studies, {\textgreater}1200 patients). These studies originated from ten different  countries, in particular {UK}, Japan, and China. Further, correlative studies (15 studies, {\textgreater}8500 patients) have shown that {NLR} is elevated in patients with more advanced or aggressive disease evidenced by increased tumour stage, nodal stage,  number of metastatic lesions and as such these patients may represent a particularly high-risk patient population. Further studies investigating the tumour and host-derived factors regulating the systemic inflammatory response, in particular the {NLR}, may identify novel treatment strategies for patients with cancer.},

Measurements were made after an overnight fast and during glucose infusion (3.5 mg/kg/min). Turnover rates were calculated from plateau isotopic enrichment of palmitate in plasma during a continuous infusion of 1-13C palmitate. Palmitate turnover was higher in the cancer group before (180\%) and during glucose loading  (170\%) compared with the control group. Palmitate turnover was reduced during glucose administration by approximately 34\% in both groups. Plasma concentration  of insulin was decreased and of cortisol was increased in the cancer group compared with the control group before and during glucose infusion. We conclude that cancer patients with weight loss have increased rates of fatty acid turnover indicative of enhanced mobilisation of body fat stores.

The authors concluded that combined {EUS}-{FNA} and {ERCP} was technically feasible, and could safely and effectively achieve a diagnosis and biliary drainage. The adverse event rate was acceptable; pancreatitis was the most common complication. Such a one-step approach is, therefore, beneficial and calls for the founding of well-equipped units with adequately skilled endoscopy and support staff.},

The extent of weight loss, the systemic inflammatory response (C-reactive protein) and quality of life ({EORTC}-{QLQ}-C30) was measured in 106 patients with inoperable {NSCLC} (stage {III} and {IV}). Approximately 40\% had more than 5\% weight loss and almost 80\% had elevated circulating C-reactive protein concentrations ({\textgreater}10 mg/l). The functional scale scores of the {EORTC}-{QLQ}-C30 were  poor (50 or less) and the fatigue symptom score was also poor (50 or more). When  patients were grouped according to whether or not they had experienced more than  5\% weight loss, Karnofsky performance status and global quality of life were lower (P{\textless}0.05) and symptom scores fatigue (P{\textless}0.05) and pain (P{\textless}0.01) were greater in the weight-losing group. When the weight-stable cancer patients were grouped according to whether or not they had evidence of a systemic inflammatory response, the symptom fatigue was higher in the inflammatory group (P{\textless}0.05). In the weight-stable cancer patients C-reactive protein concentration was correlated with fatigue r=0.31 (P{\textless}0.05). The results of the present study indicate that both weight loss and the systemic inflammatory response impact on different aspects of quality of life.

	abstract = {Electron transport capacity of skeletal muscle was inhibited in situ in an acute dose-dependent manner with myxothiazol, a tight-binding inhibitor of ubiquinone-cytochrome c reductase, complex {III} of the respiratory chain. Peak oxygen consumption of rat hindlimb muscle was determined via consecutive 10-min isometric contraction (100 ms at 100 Hz) periods of increasing energy demands (4, 8, 15, 30, 45, and 60 tetani/min), using an isolated hindlimb preparation perfused with a high oxygen delivery (approximately 6-8 mumol.min-1.g-1). Peak oxygen consumption decreased from 4.61 +/- 0.19 mumol.min-1.g-1 (control) in a dose-dependent manner to 0.73 +/- 0.07 mumol.min-1.g-1 at 0.50 {microM} myxothiazol in blood. Oxygen extraction decreased from 65 to 12\% of delivered oxygen. Furthermore, the reduction in peak respiratory rate became evident at lower energy demands of the contraction sequence. Myxothiazol inhibition of respiration was not dependent on the presence of muscle contractions but was evident when mitochondria were uncoupled with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. A 50\% effective dosage ({ED}50) of 0.21 {microM} myxothiazol for inhibition of peak oxygen consumption closely resembled the inhibition of {NADH}-cytochrome c reductase activity ({ED}50 of 0.27 {microM}) determined from homogenates of the same muscles. This suggests that the peak oxygen consumption of skeletal muscle is tightly coupled to the capacity for electron transport evaluated by flux through {NADH}-cytochrome c reductase. If the enzyme activity measured in vitro correctly represents available enzymatic capacity within contracting muscle, approximately 75\% of electron transport capacity for handling reducing equivalents generated from {NADH} is utilized during peak oxygen consumption of rat hindlimb muscle contracting in situ.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To evaluate the relation between delay in surgery because of preoperative biliary drainage ({PBD}) and survival in patients scheduled for surgery for pancreatic head cancer. {BACKGROUND}: Patients with obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic head cancer can undergo {PBD}. The associated delay of surgery can lead to more advanced cancer stages at surgical exploration, affecting resection rate and survival. {METHODS}: We conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial to compare {PBD} with early surgery ({ES}) for pancreatic head cancer for complications. We obtained Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival for patients with pathology-proven malignancy and compared survival functions of {ES} and {PBD} groups using log-rank test statistics. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic role of time to surgery for overall survival. {RESULTS}: Mean times from randomization to surgery were 1.2 (0.9-1.5) and 5.1 (4.8-5.5) weeks in the {ES} and {PBD} groups, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001). In the {ES} group, 60 (67\%) of 89 patients underwent resection, versus 53 (58\%) of 91 patients in the {PBD} group (P = 0.20). Median survival after randomization was 12.2 (9.1-15.4) months in the {ES} group versus 12.7 (8.9-16.6) months in the {PBD} group (P = 0.91). A longer time to surgery was significantly associated with slightly lower mortality rate after surgery (hazard ratio = 0.90, 95\% {CI}, 0.83-0.97), when taking into account resection, bilirubin, complications, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, tumor-positive lymph nodes, and microscopically residual disease. {CONCLUSIONS}: In patients with pancreatic head cancer, the delay in surgery associated with {PBD} does not impair or benefit survival rate.},

This study evaluates the presence of the obesity paradox in a general surgery population, reporting both postoperative and long-term survival. Methods This retrospective study included 10,427 patients scheduled for elective, noncardiac surgery. Patients were classified as underweight (body mass index ({BMI}) {\textless} 18.5 kg/m2); normal weight ({BMI} 18.5–24.9 kg/m2); overweight ({BMI} 25.0–29.9 kg/m2); obesity class I ({BMI} 30.0–34.9 kg/m2); obesity class {II} ({BMI} 35.0–39.9 kg/m2); and obesity class {III} ({BMI} ≥ 40.0 kg/m2). Study endpoints were 30-day postoperative and long-term mortality, including cause-specific mortality. Multivariable analyses were used to evaluate mortality risks for each {BMI} category. Results Within 30 days after surgery, 353 (3.4 \%) patients died. Overweight was the only category associated with postoperative mortality, showing improved survival [odds ratio 0.7; 95 \% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.6–0.9]. During the long-term follow-up 4,884 (47 \%) patients died. Underweight patients had the highest mortality risk [hazard ratio ({HR}) 1.4; 95 \% {CI} 1.2–1.6), particularly due to high cancer-related deaths. In contrast, overweight and obese patients demonstrated improved survival (overweight: {HR} 0.8, 95 \% {CI} 0.8–0.9; obesity class I: {HR} 0.7, 95 \% {CI} 0.7–0.8; obesity class {II}: {HR} 0.7, 95 \% {CI} 0.6–0.9; obesity class {III}: {HR} 0.7, 95 \% {CI} 0.5–1.0), mainly because of a strongly reduced risk of cancer-related death. Conclusions In this surgical population the obesity paradox was validated at the long term, mainly because of decreased cancer-related deaths among obese patients.},

Data on patient demographics, comorbidity and results of pre-operative evaluation were collected. Post-operative adverse events, hospital stay and receipt of adjuvant therapy were outcome measures. {RESULTS}: One hundred patients were included. Patients with an anaerobic threshold less than 10 ml/kg/min had a significantly greater incidence of a post-operative pancreatic fistula [International Study Group for Pancreatic Surgery ({ISGPS}) Grades A-C, 35.4\% versus 16\%, P = 0.028] and major intra-abdominal abscesses [Clavien-Dindo ({CD}) Grades {III}-V, 22.4\% versus 7.8\%, P = 0.042] and were less likely to receive adjuvant therapy [hazard ratio ({HR}) 6.30, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.25-31.75, P = 0.026].

Previous studies have demonstrated that socioeconomic deprivation is associated with poorer survival in patients with colorectal cancer. These differences have been attributed to more advanced disease at presentation.
Methods:
A total of 2269 patients undergoing resection for colorectal cancer in hospitals in central Scotland between 1991 and 1994 were studied. Socioeconomic status was defined using the Carstairs deprivation index. The impact of deprivation on case mix, treatment and outcome was analysed.
Results:
There were no significant differences in mode of presentation, extent of disease at presentation, type of resection and postoperative mortality rate among the socioeconomic groups. Following curative resection, the overall survival rate at 5 years was 47·0 per cent in deprived patients, compared with 55·4 per cent in affluent patients (P = 0·05); the cancer-specific survival rate was 62·6 per cent in the deprived and 68·1 per cent in the affluent (P = 0·05). Compared with the affluent, the adjusted hazard ratios for the deprived were 1·36 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 1·09 to 1·69) for overall mortality and 1·26 (95 per cent c.i. 0·95 to 1·67) for cancer-specific mortality. Following palliative resection, there was no difference in survival between the affluent and deprived for either overall (P = 0·27) or cancer-specific (P = 0·89) mortality.
Conclusion:
These findings confirm that the cancer-specific survival rate following surgery for colorectal cancer is lower in deprived patients. Stage of disease at presentation and type of operation did not account for this difference. The excess mortality was confined to patients undergoing apparently curative resection. © 2002 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd},

	abstract = {Occasionally, gastroenterologists harbour reservations about the appropriateness of various procedures and management options, yet find themselves drawn into a competition and forced by outside exigencies to provide such services. The aim of the present analysis was to describe patterns of runaway competitions and factors that influence their occurrence in gastroenterology. The interactions between two physicians or physician and patient are modelled as non-zero-sum games of two players. The outcomes associated with two behavioural strategies of two players are arranged in a two-by-two game matrix. Many scenarios of clinical gastroenterology and social interactions among gastroenterologists are characterized by the underlying game of prisoner's dilemma, where two players can choose to co-operate or compete with each other. Although from their joint perspective co-operation results in a higher joint utility, the perspective of each individual favours competition. Following the inescapable logic of their individual perspective, the players end up with a worse outcome than through co-operation. A runaway competition ensues if the game is played repeatedly with players successively increasing their stakes. Ultimately, each player tries to outdo the opponent while heading in the wrong direction. Recognizing the hallmarks of the game of prisoner's dilemma may help gastroenterologists to avoid such competitions.},

The authors selected a common clinical problem, carcinoma of the rectum, and examined the utilities assigned to colostomy, a common outcome of treatment for that disease. After preparing and validating a description of colostomy and its effects on patients' lives, utilities for the state were obtained from five groups of individuals. These comprised two groups of patients who received treatment for rectal cancer, a group of physicians and surgeons specializing in the treatment of this disease, and two groups of healthy subjects, none of whom were health professionals. Of the patients who had been treated for rectal cancer, one group had been treated surgically with the formation of colostomies and the other had been treated with radiotherapy and none had a colostomy. Utilities for colostomy were elicited using the standard gamble, category rating, and a treatment choice question naire. The groups differed substantially in the utilities assigned to colostomy. In general, patients with colostomies and physicians assigned significantly higher utilities than did pa tients who did not themselves have a colostomy. The clinical significance of these differences was examined in a simplified clinical decision problem that compared surgery (with colostomy) and radiotherapy (without colostomy) as primary treatment. The expected clinical value of these treatment alternatives was substantially influenced by the differences observed in utilities for colostomy. These results emphasize the importance of patient utilities in clinical decision making and the need to gain greater understanding of the factors that influence the utilities that patients assign to health states.

In patients with pancreatic cancer an acute-phase  response (an index of pro-inflammatory cytokine activity) is associated with accelerated weight loss, hypermetabolism, anorexia, and a shortened duration of survival. However, little is known about the primary significance of the acute-phase response in terms of altered hepatic export protein synthesis rates and its potential impact on the body's nitrogen economy. In a recent series of studies on weight-losing pancreatic cancer patients with hypoalbuminemia we have  demonstrated albumin synthesis to be unaltered whereas fibrinogen synthesis is increased two- to threefold compared with healthy controls. Because of the mismatch in amino acid composition between the body's main labile amino acid reserve (skeletal muscle) and that of acute-phase proteins, these results lend support to the concept that in pancreatic cancer the reprioritization of body protein metabolism during an acute-phase response may well be a significant factor in the loss of lean tissue in these patients.},

The preoperative surgical evaluation of a pancreatic lesion aims to define the nature of the lesion (malignant or benign), stage the tumor, and to determine resectability or other non-surgical treatment options. Patients are often elderly and may have significant comorbidities and malnutrition. Obstructive jaundice may lead to coagulopathy, infection, renal dysfunction, and adverse outcomes. Routine preoperative biliary drainage can result in higher complication rates, and metal stents may be preferred over plastic stents in selected patients with resectable disease. Judicious use of antibiotics and maintaining fluid volume preoperatively can reduce the incidence of infection and renal dysfunction, respectively. Perioperative fluid therapy with hemodynamic optimization using minimally invasive monitoring may help improve outcomes. Careful patient selection, appropriate preoperative evaluation and optimization can greatly contribute to a favorable outcome after major pancreatic resections.},

	abstract = {Immunological parameters were measured in order to elucidate a postoperative immunosuppression mechanism in transthoracic esophagectomy for patients with esophageal cancer. Moreover, lymphokine-activated killer ({LAK}) cells were transferred just after the surgery to overcome the postoperative immunosuppression. Fifteen consecutive patients who underwent transthoracic esophagectomy were subjected to the postoperative measurement of immunological parameters. Ten patients who underwent open cholecystectomy served as controls. Heparinized venous blood was obtained pre- and postoperatively, and serum levels of cytokines {IL}-6 and {IL}-10 and immunosuppressive acidic protein ({IAP}) were measured. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry for phenotype detection and by a mixed lymphocyte reaction for detecting concanavalin (Con)-A-induced or -non-induced suppressor activity. Another 29 consecutive patients who underwent transthoracic esophagectomy were randomly enrolled in a postoperative immunotherapy trial either with or without lymphokine-activated killer cells. It was found that, in the esophagectomy group, {IL}-6 and {IL}-10 increased postoperatively and peaked on day 1, followed by an increase in {IAP}, peaked again on day 4, with a profound decrease in helper and cytotoxic T-cell subsets, followed by increases in Con-A-induced (on day 7 or later) and spontaneous (on day 10) suppressor activities. These changes were minimal in the cholecystectomy group. {LAK} cell transfer restored the postoperative decrease in the helper and cytotoxic T-cell population, and there was a trend of reduction for postoperative remote infection such as pneumonia and surgical site infection in the {LAK} therapy group. Taken together, we would like to propose the existence of a postoperative immunosuppression cascade consisting of increases in cytokines and immunosuppressive proteins, decreases in helper and cytotoxic T-cell populations, and the development of suppressor T-cell activities in surgery for esophageal cancer. Postoperative adoptive transfer of {LAK} cells may be a novel clinical application in surgery for esophageal cancer as a means of treating this postoperative immunosuppressive condition that may be identical to the status of compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome ({CARS}).},

Irreversible electroporation ({IRE}) is a non-thermal ablation technique that could allow ablation in the pancreas while preserving vital surrounding blood vessels. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and ablation volume of {IRE} in porcine pancreatic tissue.
{METHODS}: {IRE} of swine pancreases was performed using an open technique and ultrasound guidance and the animals were followed for 72 hr, 7 days, and 14 days post-{IRE}.
{RESULTS}: All pigs underwent {IRE}, with one pig was unsuccessful after three attempts using at 3,000 V due to inability to achieve a stable current. All animals recovered well and revealed only mild adhesions, no ascites, and no pancreatic necrosis. All animals had transient increases in amylase and lipase that normalized on post-{IRE} day 3. Pathologic analysis revealed that ablation defects (median size 3 cm × 2.8 cm) were seen in electroporated areas with significant destruction of the pancreatic tissue with patent vascular structures.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This animal model demonstrates that {IRE} of the pancreas performed at an optimal voltage is well tolerated, with rapid resolution of pancreatic inflammation and preservation of vascular structures.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: In the new era of revalidation, there is an increasing need to measure surgical outcome objectively. We apply a graphical method, the Variable Life Adjusted Display ({VLAD}), to esophagogastric resection for malignancy. This technique charts the cumulative difference between expected and actual risk-adjusted mortality over time, allowing observation of performance trends irrespective of case-mix.
{METHODS}: P-{POSSUM} was applied retrospectively to 182 consecutive patients who underwent resection for esophageal or gastric malignancy in a district general hospital. The primary outcome measured was 30-day mortality.
{RESULTS}: A total of 168 patients were eligible for inclusion, with a median age of 68 years. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 4.2\% compared with 7.1\% as predicted by P-{POSSUM}. The resulting {VLAD} plot demonstrates an upward trend of better than predicted surgical performance.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {VLAD} has been hereby applied to esophagogastric surgery and has graphically demonstrated risk-adjusted trends in a single general surgeon's performance. For qualitative comparative purposes, including recertification, {VLAD} is judged to be a simple, directly interpretable, and useful technique for monitoring surgical performance.},

	abstract = {Background: Socioeconomic inequalities in survival were observed for many cancers in England during 1981–1999. The {NHS} Cancer Plan (2000) aimed to improve survival and reduce these inequalities. This study examines trends in the deprivation gap in cancer survival after implementation of the Plan.
Materials and method: We examined relative survival among adults diagnosed with 1 of 21 common cancers in England during 1996–2006, followed up to 31 December 2007. Three periods were defined: 1996–2000 (before the Cancer Plan), 2001–2003 (initialisation) and 2004–2006 (implementation). We estimated the difference in survival between the most deprived and most affluent groups (deprivation gap) at 1 and 3 years after diagnosis, and the change in the deprivation gap both within and between these periods.
Results: Survival improved for most cancers, but inequalities in survival were still wide for many cancers in 2006. Only the deprivation gap in 1-year survival narrowed slightly over time. A majority of the socioeconomic disparities in survival occurred soon after a cancer diagnosis, regardless of the cancer prognosis.
Conclusion: The recently observed reduction in the deprivation gap was minor and limited to 1-year survival, suggesting that, so far, the Cancer Plan has little effect on those inequalities. Our findings highlight that earlier diagnosis and rapid access to optimal treatment should be ensured for all socioeconomic groups.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether Tc-{GSA} liver scintigraphy can assess hepatic functional risk in patients with pancreatic, biliary, and ampullary carcinomas complicated by obstructive jaundice. {METHODS}: Liver scintigraphy was performed before biliary drainage in 18 patients with obstructive jaundice. The maximum removal rate of Tc-{GSA} ({GSA}-Rmax; standard normal value {\textgreater} or = 0.60) was calculated. These patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with wide lymphadenectomy. The efficacy of preoperative biliary drainage was assessed with the decrease in serum bilirubin concentration in the first week after biliary drainage. Postoperative liver function was assessed with the increase in serum bilirubin concentration, which was the difference between the immediate preoperative and maximal postoperative bilirubin concentrations. {RESULTS}: Serum bilirubin decreased more in the first week after biliary drainage in patients with {GSA}-Rmax {\textgreater} or = 0.60 (7.64 +/- 1.09 mg/Dl/wk) than in patients with {GSA}-Rmax {\textless} 0.60 (3.56 +/- 1.25 mg/{DL}/wk, p = 0.042). Postoperative bilirubin increased less in patients with {GSA}-Rmax {\textgreater} or = 0.60 (0.81 +/- 0.30 mg/{dL}) than in patients with {GSA}-Rmax {\textless} 0.60 (4.00 +/- 0.69 mg/{DL}, p = 0.0012).

A palliative procedure was performed in 252 patients (53\%). {METHODS}: Clinical data, surgical procedures and the following morbidity and mortality were recorded on standardized forms. The risk factors were analyzed by a logistic multiple regression model. {RESULTS}: The morbidity, reoperation, and mortality rates were 43, 18, and 11\% after radical surgery and 23, 4, and 14\% after palliative surgery. Karnofsky's index was the sole independent risk factor for death after radical surgery. Splenectomy, age, and {TNM} stage influenced morbidity. Diabetes, Karnofsky's index, and liver metastases were risk factors in palliative surgery. {CONCLUSIONS}: The morbidity and mortality risks were comparable between total pancreatectomy and a Whipple's procedure and between biliary and a double bypass. Preoperative biliary drainage had no impact on the risks and may be abandoned. High age is a relative and a low Karnofsky's index an absolute contraindication for radical surgery.

The impact of prehabilitation on recovery of function al exercise capacity was thus studied in patients undergoing colorectal resection for cancer.
{METHODS}: A parallel-arm single-blind superiority randomized controlled trial was conducted. Seventy-seven patients were randomized to receive either prehabilitation (n = 38) or rehabilitation (n = 39). Both groups received a home-based intervention of moderate aerobic and resistance exercises, nutritional counseling with protein supplementation, and relaxation exercises initiated either 4 weeks before surgery (prehabilitation) or immediately after surgery (rehabilitation), and continued for 8 weeks after surgery. Patients were managed with an enhanced recovery pathway. Primary outcome was functional exercise capacity measured using the validated 6-min walk test.
{RESULTS}: Median duration of prehabilitation was 24.5 days. While awaiting surgery, functional walking capacity increased (≥ 20 m) in a higher proportion of the prehabilitation group compared with the rehabilitation group (53 vs. 15\%, adjusted P = 0.006). Complication rates and duration of hospital stay were similar. The difference between baseline and 8-week 6-min walking test was significantly higher in the prehabilitation compared with the rehabilitation group (+23.7 m [{SD}, 54.8] vs. -21.8 m [{SD}, 80.7]; mean difference 45.4 m [95\% {CI}, 13.9 to 77.0]).

In colorectal cancer, the presence  of peri-tumoural inflammatory/lymphocytic infiltrates predicts improved survival. To date, these infiltrates, assessed visually on haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained sections, have failed to enter routine clinical practice, partly due to their subjective assessment and considerable inter-observer variation. The present study aims to develop an automated scoring method to enable consistent and reproducible assessment of tumour inflammatory infiltrates in colorectal cancer. {METHODS}: 154 colorectal cancer patients who underwent curative resection  were included in the study. The local inflammatory infiltrate was assessed using  the method described by Klintrup-Makinen. H\&E tumour sections were uploaded to an image analysis programme (Slidepath, Leica Biosystems). An image analysis algorithm was developed to count the inflammatory cells at the invasive margin. The manual and automated assessments of the tumour inflammatory infiltrates were  then compared. {RESULTS}: The automated inflammatory cell counts assessed using the freehand annotation method (p{\textless}0.001) and the rectangular box method (p{\textless}0.001) were significantly associated with both K-M score (p{\textless}0.001) and K-M grade (p{\textless}0.001).

This has been attributed to the detection of more early stage disease. It is well known that in addition to stage at presentation there are a variety of other key  factors that determine a patient's outcome following a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. For example there are tumour-related factors, such the presence of venous invasion and tumour necrosis, and also host-related factors, both in terms of demographic profile and an elevated circulating host inflammatory response that have been shown to be predictive of a poorer outcome. The present review summarises both the background behind the current screening programme and the observed and anticipated impact that colorectal cancer screening will have on the key determinants of outcome.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: To examine the effect of body mass index ({BMI}) on clinicopathologic factors and long-term survival in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
{METHODS}: Data on {BMI}, weight loss, operative details, surgical pathology, and long-term survival were collected on 795 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. Patients were categorized as obese ({BMI} {\textgreater} 30 kg/m(2)), overweight ({BMI} 25 to {\textless}30 kg/m(2)), or normal weight ({BMI} {\textless} 25 kg/m(2)) and compared using univariate and multivariate analyses.
{RESULTS}: At the time of surgery, 14\% of patients were obese, 33\% overweight, and 53\% normal weight. Overall, 32\% of patients had preoperative weight loss of {\textgreater}10\%. There were no differences in operative times among the groups; however, higher {BMI} was associated with increased risk of blood loss (P {\textless} 0.001) and pancreatic fistula (P = 0.01). On pathologic analysis, {BMI} was not associated with tumor stage or number of lymph nodes harvested (both P {\textgreater} 0.05). Higher {BMI} patients had a lower incidence of a positive retroperitoneal/uncinate margin versus normal weight patients (P = 0.03). Perioperative morbidity and mortality were similar among the groups. Obese and overweight patients had better 5-year survival (22\% and 22\%, respectively) versus normal weight patients (15\%; P = 0.02). After adjusting for other prognostic factors, as well as preoperative weight loss, higher {BMI} remained independently associated with improved cancer-specific survival (overweight: hazard ratio, 0.68; obese: hazard ratio, 0.72; both P {\textless} 0.05).
{CONCLUSION}: Obese patients had similar tumor-specific characteristics, as well as perioperative outcomes, compared with normal weight patients.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To examine whether surgical stress causes blood cells to lose their responsiveness to endotoxin during surgery.
{DESIGN}: Prospective case series.
{SETTING}: A university hospital.
{PATIENTS}: Sixteen volunteers classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-{II} who were scheduled for elective distal partial gastrectomy.
{INTERVENTIONS}: We studied nine patients who underwent elective distal partial gastrectomy. Blood samples for tumor necrosis factor ({TNF}) and interleukin ({IL})-10 assay were obtained before anesthesia, preincision, 2 hrs and 4 hrs postincision, postextubation, and 24 hrs postincision. The rest of each blood sample was diluted with 5 volumes of endotoxin-free saline, incubated for 4 hrs in the presence of lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}), centrifuged to remove cells, and assayed for {TNF}. In another seven patients, antihuman {IL}-10 antibody was added into the diluted whole blood sample before {LPS} stimulation.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: {TNF} activity was not detected in the blood of any patient throughout the study. In contrast, plasma cortisol and {IL}-10 levels increased rapidly during surgery (p {\textless} .01, p {\textless} .05, respectively). {LPS}-induced {TNF} activity in whole blood decreased significantly during surgery (p {\textless} .01) and recovered to control levels by 24 hrs postincision. The peak suppression of {LPS}-induced {TNF} and the peak value of plasma {IL}-10 levels occurred postextubation. Treatment with anti-{IL}-10 antibody partially restored the ability of {LPS} to induce {TNF} activity postextubation (p {\textless} .05).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Surgical trauma rapidly induces a transient hyporesponsiveness of blood cells to endotoxin. Plasma {IL}-10, which increases during surgery, participates in this hyporesponsiveness.},

	doi = {10.1002/bjs.5357},
	abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to examine the influence of social deprivation on postoperative mortality and length of stay in patients having surgery for colorectal cancer. Methods: Data were extracted from the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland database of patients presenting between April 2001 and March 2002. The effect of social deprivation, measured by the Townsend score, on 30-day postoperative mortality and length of stay was evaluated by two-level hierarchical regression analysis. Results: A total of 7290 (86.8 per cent) patients underwent surgery. Operative mortality was 6.7 per cent and median length of stay 11 days. Deprivation indices were significantly higher in patients with Dukes' 'D' cancers, undergoing emergency surgery and with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists ({ASA}) grades (P {\textless} 0.005). Worsening deprivation was associated with higher operative mortality and longer stay (P = 0.014). For each unit increase in deprivation, there was 2.9 (95 per cent confidence interval 0.5 to 5.2) per cent increase in 30-day mortality. On multifactorial analysis, social deprivation was an independent predictor of length of stay, but its effect on operative mortality was explained by differences in {ASA} grade, operative urgency and Dukes' classification. Conclusion: Social deprivation was an independent risk factor of postoperative length of stay and associated with higher postoperative mortality. These results have important implications for risk modelling of postoperative outcomes.},

	abstract = {The present study was conducted to analyse the effect on haemodynamics and to evaluate the role of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction ({HPV}) in cirrhotic patients with hypoxaemia using almitrine bismesylate, an agent which increases the response of {HPV}. Six male patients, mean age of 51 years, with hepatic cirrhosis and associated hypoxaemia were studied. All patients had normal lung and cardiac function tests. When the patients were clinically stable, right heart and radial artery catheterization were performed. Data from the pulmonary artery catheter and blood gases were obtained before and after 4 days of oral almitrine bismesylate. The results indicated that these cirrhotics were in a mild hyperdynamic circulatory state. The cardiac output ({CO}), cardiac index ({CI}), oxygen delivery ({DO}2), and oxygen consumption ({VO}2) were elevated while the pulmonary vascular resistance ({PVR}) and systemic vascular resistance ({SVR}) were low. Almitrine significantly increased {PVR} (P {\textless} 0.05) and mean pulmonary artery pressure ({mPAP}) (P {\textless} 0.01). In addition, almitrine improved alveolar arterial oxygen content difference [D(A-a)O2] (P {\textless} 0.01) and shunt fraction (Qva/{QT}) (P {\textless} 0.01). The {PaCO}2 and {PaO}2 increased slightly but this was not statistically significant. In conclusion, in our group of patients with hepatic cirrhosis, four days of treatment with almitrine improved their gas exchange. The data suggest a weak {HPV} response in this group of cirrhotics; that response may be enhanced by almitrine.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Traditional tumor-based staging systems provide limited information on the best treatment option for individual patients with advanced inoperable non-small cell lung cancer ({NSCLC}). The Glasgow prognostic score ({GPS}) reflects the host systemic inflammatory response and is a validated independent prognostic factor in these patients. The aim of this study was to examine the clinical application of the pretreatment {GPS} in a mature cohort of patients with inoperable {NSCLC}. {METHODS}: The data of 261 patients with inoperable {NSCLC} were collected prospectively and before treatment. Information on patient demographics, body mass index, performance status ({PS}), the modified Glasgow prognostic score ({mGPS}), the prognostic index, and treatment received were included. {RESULTS}: The majority of patients were aged 65 years or older (68\%), were men (59\%), had a body mass index more than 20 (89\%), and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ({ECOG}-{PS}) 0 or 1 (54\%). Most patients had a pretreatment {mGPS} = 1 (62\%) and pretreatment prognostic index = 1  (56\%). During the follow-up period, 248 (95\%) patients died, 246 from their disease. The median survival was 8 months. On multivariate analysis, age (p = 0.001), {ECOG}-{PS} (p {\textless} 0.05), {mGPS} (p {\textless} 0.0001), and tumor stage (p {\textless} 0.0001) were  independently associated with cancer-specific survival. Using 5-year cancer-specific mortality as an end point, the area under the receiver operator curve was 0.735 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.566-0.903; p = 0.024) for the {mGPS}, 0.669 (95\% {CI}, 0.489-0.848; p = 0.106) for {ECOG}-{PS}, and 0.622 (95\% {CI}, 0.437-0.807; p = 0.240) for tumor, node, metastasis stage. Patients with an increased {mGPS} were more likely to have a poorer {ECOG}-{PS} (p {\textless} 0.05), an increased white cell count (p {\textless} 0.05), and received palliative treatment (p {\textless} 0.05). {CONCLUSION}: The pretreatment {mGPS} is a useful and important predictor of cancer-specific survival in patients with inoperable {NSCLC}.

The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound to the diagnosis or staging, or both, of pancreatic lesions. {PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: Fifty-two patients were diagnosed preoperatively with pancreatic cancer. The diagnoses made by laparoscopic ultrasonography ({LUS}) were compared with those made prior to the operation. Laparoscopic visualization of the body of the pancreas was obtained via an infragastric approach. For the laparoscopic examination of the head of the pancreas, a retroduodenal approach was used. {RESULTS}: In 52 patients with cancer of the pancreatic head and body, unresectable findings were observed in 13 patients. Portal vein displacement without other unresectable findings was evident in six patients using {LUS}, and was confirmed at exploratory laparotomy in five patients. The surgical approaches were changed, with seven patients undergoing an open exploration for biliary drainage and the other six patients receiving endoscopic endoprostheses. In six of the 52 patients, {LUS}-guided needle biopsies and frozen-section examinations detected chronic pancreatitis (n = 4), a malignant lymphoma (n = 1), and an abdominal tuberculosis (n = 1), which were diagnosed preoperatively as pancreatic cancers and cysts. Only one patient undergoing the laparoscopic procedure had acute pancreatitis; this patient was treated conservatively. {CONCLUSIONS}: {LUS}, when combined with laparoscopic manipulations, may overcome many of the limitations of laparoscopy alone in the investigation of pancreatic lesions by providing an accurate diagnosis and assessment of the size and extent of the local dissemination.},

	abstract = {{AbstarctBackground} \&amp; Aims
Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms ({IPMN}) of the pancreas occur mostly in older individuals. Individual life expectancy and risk of death from other factors must be carefully considered in analyzing the risks that {IPMNs} pose. We investigated whether there is a subset of patients with {IPMNs} and a high risk of dying from other causes who would not benefit from pancreatic surgery.
Methods
We collected data from 725 patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital who underwent resection or have been under observation for {IPMN} from 1992 through 2012. Comorbidities were classified according the age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index ({CACI}). Causes of death were recorded and survival data were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
Results
The patients’ median {CACI} score was 3; 10\% of patients had a {CACI} of 7 or more. Of the entire cohort, 55\% underwent resection and the remaining 45\% have been under observation. After a median follow-up period of 5 y, 177 patients died (24\%; 55\% of deaths within 5 y of diagnosis); 78\% of deaths were not related to {IPMN}. The median survival time for all patients with a {CACI} score of 7 or more was 43 months. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the chance of non-{IPMN}−related death within 3 y of diagnosis is 11-fold higher for patients with a {CACI} score of 7 or more than for patients with lower scores.
Conclusion
The {CACI} can be used to identify patients with a high risk of death from factors other than {IPMN} within a few years after diagnosis. These patients are therefore not likely to benefit from further {IPMN} observation or pancreatic resection.},

Further, the effect of moderating the inflammatory response, using the anti-inflammatory agent ibuprofen, on these measurements was  examined in the cancer group. The control and cancer groups were similar in terms of age, sex, and body mass index. However, the cancer group had significantly higher C-reactive protein concentrations (P {\textless} 0.001). Concentrations of vitamin antioxidants and trace elements (and carrier proteins) were significantly lower (P {\textless} 0.001), except copper (ceruloplasmin) which was significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05). After anti-inflammatory treatment, there were small but significant increases in lutein, lycopene, and beta-carotene (P {\textless} 0.05) and in iron and selenium (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas ceruloplasmin decreased (P {\textless} 0. 05). The micronutrient concentrations in the cancer patients remained different from those in the control subjects. These results support the concept that the magnitude of  inflammation plays an important role in the regulation of circulating concentrations of vitamin antioxidants and trace elements in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Irreversible electroporation ({IRE}) is a novel technology that uses peri-target discrete probes to deliver high-voltage localized electric current to induce cell death without thermal-induced coagulative necrosis. "Learnability" and consistently effective results by novice practitioners is essential for determining acceptance of novel techniques. This multi-center prospectively-collected database study evaluates the learning curve of {IRE}.
{METHODS}: Analysis of 150 consecutive patients over 7 institutions from 9/2010-7/2012 was performed with patients treated divided into 3 groups A (1(st) 50 patients treated), B (2(nd) 50) and C (3(rd) 50 patients treated) chronologically and analyzed for outcomes.
{RESULTS}: A total of 167 {IRE} procedures were performed, with a majority being liver(39.5\%) and pancreatic(35.5\%) lesions. The three groups were similar with respect to co-morbidities and demographics. Group C had larger lesions (3.9 vs 3 cm,p=0.001), more numerous lesions (3.2 vs 2.2,p=0.07), more vascular invasion(p=0.001), underwent more associated procedures(p=0.001) and had longer operative times(p{\textless}0.001). Despite this, they had similar complication and high-grade complication rates(p=0.24). Attributable morbidity rate was 13.3\%(total 29.3\%) and high-grade complications were seen in 4.19\%(total 12.6\%). Pancreatic lesions(p=0.001) and laparotomy(p=0.001) were associated with complications.
{CONCLUSION}: The review represents that single largest review of {IRE} soft tissue ablation demonstrating initial patient selection and safety. Over time, complex treatments of larger lesions and lesions with greater vascular involvement were performed without a significant increase in adverse effects or impact on local relapse free survival. This evolution demonstrates the safety profile of {IRE} and speed of graduation to more complex lesions, which was greater than 5 cases by institution. {IRE} is a safe and effective alternative to conventional ablation with a demonstrable learning curve of at least 5 cases to become proficient.},

	abstract = {Background

Postoperative pancreatic fistula is one of the most important and potentially severe complications after partial pancreaticoduodenectomy. In this context, the reduction of postoperative pancreatic fistula by means of a dual-loop (Roux-en-Y) reconstruction with isolation of the pancreaticojejunostomy from biliary drainage has been evaluated in several studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes evidence of effectiveness and safety of the isolation of the pancreaticojejunostomy compared with conventional single-loop reconstruction.


Methods

Randomized clinical trials ({RCTs}) and controlled clinical trials ({CCTs}) comparing outcomes of dual-loop reconstruction with isolated pancreaticojejunostomy and single-loop reconstruction were searched according to {PRISMA} guidelines. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed and the results presented as weighted risk ratios or mean differences with their corresponding 95 per cent c.i.


Results

Of 83 trials screened for eligibility, three {RCTs} and four {CCTs} including a total of 802 patients were finally included. Quantitative synthesis showed no significant statistical difference between the two procedures regarding postoperative pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, haemorrhage, intra-abdominal fluid collection or abscess, bile leakage, wound infection, pneumonia, overall morbidity, mortality, reinterventions, reoperations, perioperative blood loss and length of hospital stay. Duration of surgery was significantly longer in patients undergoing dual-loop reconstruction.


Conclusion

Dual-loop (Roux-en-Y) reconstruction with isolated pancreaticojejunostomy after partial pancreaticoduodenectomy is not superior to single-loop reconstruction regarding pancreatic fistula rate or other relevant outcomes. Additional superiority trials are therefore not warranted, although a high-quality trial may be justified to prove equivalence or non-inferiority.},

Despite medical optimization and radiological stenting interventions, mortality remains high and it is difficult to improve fitness. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of a 6 week, supervised exercise programme (30 min continuous moderate intensity cycle ergometry, twice weekly) on anaerobic threshold ({AT}) in subjects with {AAA}.
{METHODS}: Thirty participants with an {AAA} under surveillance were randomized to either the supervised exercise intervention (n=20) or a usual care control group (n=10). {AT} was measured using cardiopulmonary exercise testing, at baseline ({AT}1), week 5 ({AT}2), and week 7 ({AT}3). The change in {AT} ({AT}3-{AT}1) between the groups was compared using a mixed model ancova, providing the mean effect together with the standard deviation (sd) for individual patient responses to the intervention. The minimum clinically important difference ({MCID}) was defined as an improvement in {AT} of 2 ml O(2) kg(-1) min(-1).
{RESULTS}: Of the 30 participants recruited, 17 of 20 (exercise) and eight of 10 (control) completed the study. The {AT} in the intervention group increased by 10\% (equivalent to 1.1 ml O(2) kg(-1) min(-1)) compared with the control (90\% confidence interval 4-16\%; P=0.007). The sd for the individual patient responses to the intervention was 8\%. The estimated number needed to treat ({NNT}) for benefit was 5 patients.

	issn = {0090-3493},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To compare the patterns of evolution of two proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [{TNF}]-alpha and interleukin-6 [{IL}-6]) in two major clinical entities associated with systemic inflammatory response: septic shock and multiple trauma (with and without hemorrhagic shock).
{DESIGN}: Prospective study of two cohorts of patients.
{SETTING}: Critical care unit and Emergency Center of a university hospital.
{PATIENTS}: Twenty-five nontrauma patients with septic shock and 60 multiple trauma patients (of whom eight patients were resuscitated from hemorrhagic shock).
{INTERVENTIONS}: Serial blood samples were collected in each patient for determination of serum cytokine concentrations. Samples were obtained over 7 days in septic shock patients and 11 days in trauma patients. Standard resuscitation techniques were used in each patient. Clinical and laboratory data were prospectively collected.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: High concentrations of circulating {TNF}-alpha and {IL}-6 were found in patients with septic shock. High {IL}-6 concentrations, but normal {TNF}-alpha concentrations were detected in trauma patients. At study entry, {TNF}-alpha concentrations were higher in nonsurvivor septic shock than in nonsurvivor trauma patients (42 +/- 7 vs 13 +/- 2 pg/{mL}; p {\textless} .001). During the whole study period, nonsurvivor septic shock patients maintained higher {TNF}-alpha concentrations than nonsurvivor trauma patients (p {\textless} .001). In survivors in both groups, normal values for {TNF}-alpha were detected during the whole study period. At study entry, {IL}-6 concentrations were significantly higher in nonsurvivor septic shock patients than in nonsurvivor trauma patients (15,627 +/- 4336 vs. 317 +/- 124 pg/{mL}; p {\textless} .0001). During the whole study period, much higher concentrations of {IL}-6 were detected in septic shock patients than in trauma patients (p {\textless} .0001). In survivors, at study entry, {IL}-6 concentrations were much higher in septic shock patients than in trauma patients (3947 +/- 1410 vs. 247 +/- 41 pg/{mL}; p {\textless} .001). Higher {IL}-6 concentrations were maintained throughout the study period in septic shock patients than in trauma patients (p {\textless} .001). In septic shock patients, changes in both {TNF}-alpha and {IL}-6 were correlated with outcome, higher values being found in patients likely to die. Neither {TNF}-alpha nor {IL}-6 values were of any significant value in predicting outcome of trauma patients. When septic shock patients were compared with traumatized patients resuscitated from hemorrhagic shock, the former had much higher concentrations of both {TNF}-alpha and {IL}-6 throughout the study period (p {\textless} .01 to p {\textless} .00001). Increased {IL}-6 values were an indicator of the development of a nosocomial infection in trauma patients. In five trauma patients who developed a nosocomial pneumonia during the study period, the {IL}-6 concentration was 433 +/- 385 pg/{mL} before the onset of pneumonia, then peaked at 3970 +/- 1478 pg/{mL} on day 7, and returned to baseline (219 +/- 58 pg/{mL}) on day 11.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In septic shock patients, high amounts of circulating {TNF}-alpha and {IL}-6 are found and then correlate with fatal outcome. In trauma patients (even those patients resuscitated from hemorrhagic shock), much less increased concentrations of {IL}-6 are detected while normal {TNF}-alpha circulating concentrations are measured. In these patients, cytokine concentrations do not correlate with outcome. This finding suggests a much higher degree of activation of the immunoinflammatory cascade in septic shock than in multiple trauma patients. Increased {IL}-6 values are an indicator of the development of a nosocomial infection in trauma patients.},

A retrospective series of patients who had surgery for colorectal liver metastases ({CLM}) was used to assess this association.
{METHODS}: Patients who had surgery with curative intent for {CLM} from 2000 to 2009 were included. The impact of postoperative complications, patient characteristics, disease stage and treatment on long-term survival was analysed using multivariable Cox regression models.
{RESULTS}: A total of 251 patients were included. The median age was 58 (interquartile range 51-68) years and there were 87 women (34.7 per cent). A minor or major postoperative complication developed in 41 and 14 patients respectively, and five patients (2.0 per cent) died after surgery. The 5-year recurrence-free ({RFS}) and overall survival rates were 19.5 and 41.9 per cent respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that postoperative complications independently predicted shorter {RFS} (hazard ratio ({HR}) 2.36, 95 per cent confidence interval 1.56 to 3.58) and overall survival ({HR} 2.34, 1.46 to 3.74). Other independent predictors of shorter {RFS} and overall survival included lymph node metastasis, concomitant extrahepatic disease, a serum carcinoembryonic antigen level of at least 100 ng/dl, and the use of radiofrequency ablation ({RFS} only). The severity of complications also correlated with {RFS} (P = 0.006) and overall survival (P = 0.001).

Subjects: Forty-two elderly patients ({\textgreater}60 years).
Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive a short-term intensive therapeutic exercise programme to improve muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and functional activities, given in the outpatient department (intervention group; n =22), or home-based exercise advice (control group; n=20).
Main measures: Parameters of feasibility, preoperative functional capacity and postoperative course.
Results: The intensive training programme was feasible, with a high compliance and no adverse events. Respiratory muscle endurance increased in the preoperative period from 259 ± 273 to 404 ± 349 J in the intervention group and differed significantly from that in the control group (350 ± 299 to 305 ± 323 J; P{\textless}0.01). Timed-Up-and-Go, chair rise time, {LASA} Physical Activity Questionnaire, Physical Work Capacity and Quality of Life ({EORTC}-C30) did not reveal significant differences between the two groups. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications and length of hospital stay between the two groups.
Conclusion: The intensive therapeutic exercise programme was feasible and improved the respiratory function of patients due to undergo elective abdominal surgery compared with home-based exercise advice.},

	abstract = {Treatment of patients with acute pancreatitis is based on the initial assessment of disease severity. Severe pancreatitis occurs in 20\%-30\% of all patients with acute pancreatitis and is characterized by a protracted clinical course, multiorgan failure, and pancreatic necrosis. Early staging is based on the presence and degree of systemic failure (cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal) and on the presence and extent of pancreatic necrosis. Individual laboratory indexes (markers of pancreatic injury, markers of inflammatory response), while promising, have not yet gained clinical acceptance. Numeric grading systems with sensitivities of about 70\% are commonly used today as indicators of organ failure and disease severity. Contrast material-enhanced computed tomography is used in addition to help evaluate local pancreatic morphology and the presence and extent of pancreatic necrosis. Advantages and limitations of the clinical, laboratory, and imaging prognostic indexes are analyzed and discussed.},

The {POSSUM} scoring system consists of two categories of assessment to assess the risk of surgery. A 12-factor (age, cardiac status, pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, respiratory status, Glasgow Coma Score, serum concentration of urea, potassium and sodium, hemoglobin concentration, white cell count and findings on electrocardiography) and 4-grade physiological score ({PS}) were developed. This was combined with a 6-factor (type of surgical procedure, number of procedures, blood loss, peritoneal soiling, presence of malignancy and mode of surgery) and 4-grade operative severity score ({OSS}). The present paper attempts to validate it retrospectively. Postoperative hospitalization period and duration of antibiotics administration were both significantly correlated with {OSS}, but not with {PS}.

The aim of the present study was  to examine the prognostic relationship between these markers of the systemic inflammatory response and all-cause, cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality in a large incidentally sampled cohort. {METHODS}: Patients (n = 160 481) who had an incidental blood sample taken between 2000 and 2008 were studied for the prognostic value of C-reactive protein ({\textgreater}10mg/l, albumin ({\textgreater}35mg/l), neutrophil ({\textgreater}7.5x109/l) lymphocyte and platelet counts. Also, patients (n = 52 091) sampled following the introduction of high sensitivity C-reactive protein ({\textgreater}3mg/l) measurements were studied. A combination of these markers, to make cumulative inflammation-based scores, were investigated. {RESULTS}: In all patients (n = 160 481) C-reactive protein ({\textgreater}10mg/l) ({HR} 2.71, p{\textless}0.001), albumin ({\textgreater}35mg/l)  ({HR} 3.68, p{\textless}0.001) and neutrophil counts ({HR} 2.18, p{\textless}0.001) were independently predictive of all-cause mortality.

	volume = {16},
	abstract = {Typical 13C or 15N tracer studies generate large numbers of samples. Instrumentation capable of rapid automated analysis is therefore of importance as a practical alternative to conventional isotope methodology. Although biomedical  sample nature is diverse, experimenters often require analysis of substrates and  products of particular biochemical pathways. Clearly, reaction products can contain considerably less isotope tracer than precursors. Analytical techniques thus need to accommodate samples of widely varying nature, size and isotope enrichment. In the clinical field, where stable isotopes are increasingly used to study protein, carbohydrate and fat metabolism, analysis of the isotope ratio of  a substrate infused into the plasma and a product of its metabolism is often required. Conventional analytical approaches demand access to two mass spectrometers: isotope ratio mass spectrometry ({IRMS}) for isotope analysis of the relatively large concentrations of low-enrichment metabolic product, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ({GC}/{MS}) for analysis of the infused substrate often present at high enrichment but low concentration offers a practical alternative to the conventional approaches that is rapid and automatic. In addition to providing a considerably less complex and costly alternative to conventional instrumentation, a single {CF}-{IRMS} instrument can also analyse small  quantities of low-enrichment metabolites with superior performance than either of the alternative approaches. {CF}-{IRMS} is illustrated using results from constant-infusion studies in human protein and fat metabolism which require measurement of the isotope enrichment in submicromolar quantities of plasma substrates together with analysis of larger quantities of their oxidation products, urinary nitrogen and breath {CO}2.},

Therapeutic nihilism, which should be discounted in view of the results currently achieved by surgery, and noncentralization, since better results have been demonstrated, both in terms of morbidity and mortality and in survival, in high-volume centers than in low volume centers. The present review also identifies errors in management, the most important of which are: undervaluing the medical record, which is of great utility and continues to be the pillar on which the entire diagnostic process is based; the systematic use of preoperative biliary drainage, which used to be considered mandatory but should be used highly selectively in patients with severe jaundice or biliary tract infections, and viewing preoperative imaging tests as unreliable, when current radiological techniques, particularly helical computed tomography ({CT}), are highly reliable in establishing tumor resectability and consequently they should be used in all treatment planning. Moreover, because radiological tests are highly reliable, laparoscopic staging has lost diagnostic value; obtaining a preoperative histological diagnosis, which is not mandatory except when neoadjuvant therapy is planned or when tumors requiring nonsurgical treatment are suspected; undervaluing the use of surgical palliation, since this technique provides better long-term results than nonsurgical palliation, and consequently still plays a role in patients with good general health status and prolonged life expectancy; systematically performing gastrojejunostomy with bilio-enteric bypass, as this procedure should only be performed in tumors of the uncus or when there is imminent biliary or gastroduodenal obstruction; the use of supraradical surgical techniques such as regional, total or extensive pancreatectomy, since these techniques do not prolong survival after resection. Furthermore, the use of vascular resections would only be justified if resection with disease-free margins could be performed; undervaluing close postoperative monitoring within specialized units since this is the key to reducing morbidity and mortality rates in this type of surgery; and lastly when an intraoperative pancreatic incidentaloma is present, performing diagnostic maneuvers such as biopsy or pancreatic mobilization, since these procedures hamper subsequent radiological interpretation and possible surgical intervention.},

Since there were no clear cardiac or pulmonary causes to explain the decrease in work capacity, these observations suggest that liver cirrhosis might induce or be accompanied by muscular impairment. {VO}2 max, which seems to decline with the functional severity of the disease, may be a useful index for evaluating the capacity of patients for physical rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Emergency presentation is recognized to be associated with poorer cancer-specific survival following curative resection for colorectal cancer. The  present study examined the hypothesis that an enhanced systemic inflammatory response, prior to surgery, might explain the impact of emergency presentation on survival. {METHODS}: In all, 188 patients undergoing potentially curative resection for colorectal cancer were studied. Of these, 55 (29\%) presented as emergencies.  The systemic inflammatory response was assessed using the Glasgow Prognostic Score ({mGPS}), which is the combination of an elevated C-reactive protein ({\textgreater}10 mg/L) and hypoalbuminemia ({\textless}35 g/L). {RESULTS}: In the emergency group, tumor stage was greater (P {\textless} 0.01), more patients received adjuvant therapy (P {\textless} 0.01) more patients had an elevated {mGPS} (P {\textless} 0.01), and more patients died of their disease (P {\textless} 0.05). The minimum follow-up was 12 months; the median follow-up of the survivors was 48 months. Emergency presentation was associated with poorer 3-year cancer-specific survival in those patients aged 65 to 74 years (P {\textless} 0.01), in both males and females (P {\textless} 0.05), in the deprived (P {\textless} 0.01), in patients with tumor-node-metastasis ({TNM}) stage {II} disease (P {\textless} 0.01), in those who received no adjuvant therapy (P {\textless} 0.01), and in the {mGPS} 0 and 1 groups (P {\textless} 0.05) groups. On multivariate survival analysis of patients undergoing potentially curative surgery for {TNM} stage {II} colon cancer, emergency presentation (P {\textless} 0.05) and {mGPS} (P {\textless} 0.05) were independently associated with cancer-specific survival. {CONCLUSIONS}: These results suggest that emergency presentation and the presence of systemic inflammatory response prior to surgery are linked and account for poorer cancer-specific survival in patients undergoing potentially curative surgery for colon cancer. Both emergency presentation and an elevated {mGPS} should be taken into account when assessing the likely outcome of these patients.},

	abstract = {Research over the last decade has uncovered roles for bile acids ({BAs}) that extend beyond their traditional functions in regulating lipid digestion and cholesterol metabolism. {BAs} are now recognized as signaling molecules that interact with both plasma membrane and nuclear receptors. Emerging evidence indicates that by interacting with these receptors, {BAs} regulate their own synthesis, glucose and energy homeostasis, and other important physiological events. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the actions of {BAs} on cardiovascular function. In the heart and the systemic circulation, {BAs} interact with plasma membrane G-protein-coupled receptors, for example, {TGR}5 and muscarinic receptors, and nuclear receptors, for example, the farnesoid ({FXR}) and pregnane ({PXR}) xenobiotic receptors. {BA} receptors are expressed in cardiovascular tissue, however, the mechanisms underlying {BA}-mediated regulation of cardiovascular function remain poorly understood. {BAs} reduce heart rate by regulating channel conductance and calcium dynamics in sino-atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes and regulate vascular tone via both endothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms. End-stage liver disease, obstructive jaundice, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are prominent conditions in which elevated serum {BAs} alter vascular dynamics. This review focuses on {BAs} as newly recognized signaling molecules that modulate cardiovascular function.},

Patients were divided into groups: those who have not underwent {PBD}, but had preoperative bilirubin level {\textless}50 micromol/l (n=42), patients without {PBD}, but preoperative bilirubin exceeding 50 micromol/l (n=61) and patients who have undergone preoperative {PBD} (n=19). {RESULTS}: Overall morbidity following {PD} was 55.6\%. There were 10.7\% pancreatic fistulas, 13.1\% septic complications (either intraabdominal sepsis or wound infection) and 9\% of postoperative intraabdominal bleeding. Postoperative mortality was 9.8\%. There was no statistically significant difference in either overall morbidity, pancreatic fistula rates, septic complications, bleeding or postoperative mortality between jaundiced and nonjaundiced patients. Preoperative bilirubinemia in patients without {PBD} and without postoperative complications did not significantly differ from those without {PBD} who developed complications. Overall morbidity, pancreatic fistula rate, septic complications, bleeding, postoperative mortality were similar in {PBD} and {nonPBD} groups as well as in stented and nonstented patients. {CONCLUSIONS}: As obstructive jaundice has no impact on postoperative results of {PD}. {PBD} or stenting of bile ducts should not be used routinely and is justified in cases when surgery with intent for cure has to be postponed.},

	abstract = {Purpose Although obesity is associated with increased incidence of pancreatic cancer, studies have not prospectively evaluated prediagnostic body mass index ({BMI}) and survival.
Patients and Methods We analyzed survival by prediagnostic {BMI} assessed in 1986 among 902 patients from two large prospective cohorts diagnosed from 1988 to 2010. We estimated hazard ratios ({HRs}) for death using Cox proportional hazards models, with adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, diagnosis year, and stage. We evaluated the temporal association of {BMI} with survival by grouping reported {BMI} by 2-year lag-time intervals before diagnosis.
Results The multivariable-adjusted {HR} for death was 1.53 (95\% {CI}, 1.11 to 2.09) comparing patients with {BMI} ≥ 35 kg/m2 with those with {BMI} {\textless} 25 kg/m2 (P trend = .001), which was similar after adjustment for stage. The association of {BMI} with survival was stronger with longer lag times between reported {BMI} and cancer diagnosis. Among patients with {BMI} collected 18 to 20 years before diagnosis, {HR} for death was 2.31 (95\% {CI}, 1.48 to 3.61; P trend {\textless} .001), comparing obese with healthy-weight patients. No statistically significant differences were seen by cohort, smoking status, or stage, although the association was stronger among never-smokers ({HR}, 1.61; 95\% {CI}, 1.01 to 2.57; P trend = .002) than ever-smokers ({HR}, 1.36; 95\% {CI}, 0.86 to 2.15; P trend = .63), comparing {BMI} ≥ 35 kg/m2 with {BMI} {\textless} 25 kg/m2. Higher prediagnostic {BMI} was associated with more advanced stage at diagnosis, with 72.5\% of obese patients presenting with metastatic disease versus 59.4\% of healthy-weight patients (P = .02).
Conclusion Higher prediagnostic {BMI} was associated with statistically significantly decreased survival among patients with pancreatic cancer from two large prospective cohorts.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: For several types of non-cardiac surgery, the cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET})-derived variables anaerobic threshold ({AT}), peak oxygen consumption ({VO}2 peak), and ventilatory equivalent for {CO}(2) ({VE}/{VCO}2 ) are predictive of increased postoperative risk: less physically fit patients having a greater risk of adverse outcome. We investigated this relationship in patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery.
{METHODS}: All patients ({\textless}190 kg) who were referred for {CPET} and underwent elective gastric bypass surgery at the Whittington Hospital {NHS} Trust between September 1, 2009, and February 25, 2011, were included in the study (n=121). Fifteen patients did not complete {CPET}. {CPET} variables ({VO}2 peak, {AT}, and {VE}/{VCO}2 ) were derived for 106 patients. The primary outcome variables were day 5 morbidity and hospital length of stay ({LOS}). The independent t-test and Fisher's exact test were used to test for differences between surgical outcome groups. The predictive capacity of {CPET} markers was determined using receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curves.
{RESULTS}: The {AT} was lower in patients with postoperative complications than in those without [9.9 (1.5) vs 11.1 (1.7) ml kg(-1) min(-1), P=0.049] and in patients with a {LOS}{\textgreater}3 days compared with {LOS} ≤ 3 days [10.4 (1.4) vs 11.3 (1.8) ml kg(-1) min(-1), P=0.023]. {ROC} curve analysis identified {AT} as a significant predictor of {LOS}{\textgreater}3 days ({AUC} 0.640, P=0.030). The {VO}2 peak and {VE}/{VCO}2 were not associated with postoperative outcome.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {AT}, determined using {CPET}, predicts {LOS} after gastric bypass surgery.},

	abstract = {Complete surgical resection is the most effective curative treatment for lung cancer. However, many patients with lung cancer also have severe {COPD} which increases their risk of postoperative complications and their likelihood of being considered "inoperable." Preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation ({PR}) has been proposed as an intervention to decrease surgical morbidity but there is no established protocol and no randomized study has been published to date. We tested two preoperative {PR} interventions in patients undergoing lung cancer resection and with moderate-severe {COPD} in a randomized single blinded design. Outcomes were length of hospital stay and postoperative complications. The first study tested 4 weeks of guideline-based {PR} vs. usual care: that study proved to be very difficult to recruit as patients and providers were reluctant to delay surgery. Nine patients were randomized and no differences were found between arms. The second study tested ten preoperative {PR} sessions using a customized protocol with nonstandard components (exercise prescription based on self efficacy, inspiratory muscle training, and the practice of slow breathing) (n=10) vs. usual care (n=9). The {PR} arm had shorter length of hospital stay by 3 days (p=0.058), fewer prolonged chest tubes (11\% vs. 63\%, p=0.03) and fewer days needing a chest tube (8.8 vs. 4.3 days p=0.04) compared to the controlled arm. A ten-session preoperative {PR} intervention may improve post operative lung reexpansion evidenced by shorter chest tube times and decrease the length of hospital stay, a crude estimator of post operative morbidity and costs. Our results suggest the potential for short term preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation interventions in patients with moderate-severe {COPD} undergoing curative lung resection. 4 weeks of conventional preoperative {PR} seems non feasible.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {STUDY} {AIMS}: The current treatment model for the management of malignant biliary obstruction is to place a plastic stent for unstaged pancreatic cancer. In patients with unresectable disease but a life expectancy of more than 6 months, self-expandable metal stents ({SEMS}) are favored because of their more prolonged patency. We analyzed the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of covered {SEMS} ({CSEMS}) in patients with pancreatic cancer and distal biliary obstruction without regard to surgical resectability. {PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: Between March 2001 and March 2005, 101 consecutive patients with obstructive jaundice secondary to pancreatic cancer underwent placement of a {CSEMS}. Patients with resectable tumor were offered pancreaticoduodenectomy. A model was developed to compare the costs of {CSEMS} and polyethylene and {DoubleLayer} stents. {RESULTS}: A total of 21 patients underwent staging laparoscopy, of whom 16 had a resection (76\%). The 85 patients who did not have a resection had a mean survival of 5.9 months (range 1-25 months) and a mean {CSEMS} patency duration of 5.5 months (range 1-16 months). Life-table analysis demonstrated {CSEMS} patency rates of 97\% at 3 months, 85\% at 6 months, and 68\% at 12 months. In a cost model that accounted for polyethylene and {DoubleLayer} stent malfunction and surgical resections, initial {CSEMS} placement (3177 euros per patient) was a less costly intervention than either {DoubleLayer} stent placement (3224 euros per patient) or polyethylene stent placement with revision (3570 euros per patient). {CONCLUSIONS}: Covered {SEMS} are an effective treatment for distal biliary obstructions caused by pancreatic carcinoma. Their prolonged patency and removability makes them an attractive option for biliary decompression, regardless of resectability. The strategy of initial covered {SEMS} placement might be the most cost-effective strategy in these patients.},

	abstract = {Surgical patients often show physiological and metabolic distress, muscle weakness, and long hospital stays.  Physical conditioning might help recovery.  We attempted to identify the most responsive measure of aerobic fitness from a four-week pre-surgical aerobic exercise program (prehabilitation) in patients undergoing major bowel resection.  Twenty-one subjects randomized two to one (exercise: control) scheduled for colorectal surgery.  Fourteen subjects [Body Mass Index ({BMI}) = 27 ± 6 kg/m2; maximal oxygen uptake ({VO}2max) = 22 ± 10 ml/kg/min] underwent 3.8 ± 1.2 weeks (27 ± 8 sessions) of progressive, structured pre-surgical aerobic exercise training at 40 to 65\% of heart rate reserve (\%{HRR}).  Peak power output was the only maximal measure that was responsive to training [26 ± 27\%, Effects Size ({ES}) = 0.24; Standardized Response Mean ({SRM}) = 1.05; p {\textless} 0.05].  For the submaximal measures, heart rate and oxygen uptake during submaximal exercise was most responsive to training (decrease by 13\% ± 15\%, {ES} = −0.24; {SRM} = −0.57; and 7\% ± 6\%, {ES} = −0.40; {SRM} −0.97; p {\textless} 0.05) at an exercise intensity of 76 ± 47 W.  There was no change to maximal or submaximal measures in the control group.  The distance walked over six minutes improved in both groups (by ∼30 m), but the effect size and t-statistic were higher in the exercise group.  Heart rate and oxygen uptake during submaximal exercise, and peak power output are the most responsive measures to four weeks of prehabilitation in subjects with low initial fitness.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine differences in presentation and outcome in pancreaticoduodenectomy for benign and malignant processes. Pancreaticoduodenectomies performed for pancreatic adenocarcinoma or chronic pancreatitis from 2000 to 2008 were identified from a prospectively maintained database and compared. Pancreaticoduodenectomy revealed adenocarcinoma in 220 patients and benign chronic pancreatitis in 40 patients. Patients with adenocarcinoma were older (64 +/- 10.6 years and 47.6 +/- 10.8 years, respectively, P {\textless} 0.001) and more likely to demonstrate jaundice (92 and 13\%, respectively, P {\textless} 0.001), weight loss (76 and 58\%, respectively, P = 0.01), and discrete masses (72 and 55\%, respectively, P = 0.03). By contrast, chronic pancreatitis presented with increased pain (98 and 49\%, respectively, P {\textless} 0.001) and nausea (68 and 32\%, respectively, P {\textless} 0.001). Patients with pancreatitis experienced reduced blood loss (227 +/- 156 and 571 +/- 626 {mL}, respectively, P = 0.05) and transfusion (10 and 42\%, respectively, P {\textless} 0.001). Postoperatively, the groups were similar in risk of fistula, gastroparesis, overall morbidity, and mortality. Infection rates were higher in adenocarcinoma (42 and 20\%, respectively, P = 0.01). Forty-nine patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for presumptive chronic pancreatitis, of which nine had adenocarcinoma; logistic regression identified increasing age and jaundice as predictors of malignancy. Compared with patients with adenocarcinoma, those who undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy for chronic pancreatitis are less likely to require preoperative biliary drainage and perioperative transfusion. Infectious complication risk is higher in patients with adenocarcinoma. Increased age and jaundice should raise suspicion of cancer in patients with chronic pancreatitis undergoing evaluation for surgical treatment.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This prospective study investigated the factors which might indicate anastomotic leakage after low anterior resection.
{METHOD}: Thirty-three patients who underwent anterior resection for rectal carcinoma (n = 32) and severe dysplasia (n = 1), were monitored daily by serum C-reactive protein ({CRP}) and white blood cell count ({WBC}) estimations until discharge from hospital. Computed tomography ({CT}) scans were performed on postoperative days 2 and 7 and the amount of presacral fluid collection was assessed. All patients had a pelvic drain and the volume of drainage was measured daily.
{RESULTS}: The level of the anastomosis was at a median 5 cm (3-12 cm) above the anal verge. There was no 30-day mortality. Nine (27.2\%) of the 33 patients developed a symptomatic anastomotic leakage which was diagnosed at a median of 8 days (range 4-14) postoperatively. The serum {CRP} was increased in patients who leaked from postoperative day 2 onwards (P = 0.004 on day 2; P {\textless} 0.001 on day 3-8). The {WBC} was decreased in preoperatively irradiated patients on days 1-5 (P {\textless}/= 0.021), with no difference seen between patients with or without leakage. Patients with leakage had a larger presacral fluid collection on {CT} on day 7 (median 76 ml vs 52 ml; P = 0.016) and a larger increase in the fluid collection between the first and the second {CT} examinations (28 ml vs 3 ml; P = 0.046). {CONCLUSION}; An early rise in serum {CRP} was a strong indicator of leakage. Monitoring of {CRP} for possible early detection of symptomatic anastomotic leakage is recommended.},

	title = {Application of cryopreserved human hepatocytes in trichloroethylene risk assessment: relative disposition of chloral hydrate to trichloroacetate and trichloroethanol.},
	volume = {114},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Trichloroethylene ({TCE}) is a suspected human carcinogen and a common  groundwater contaminant. Chloral hydrate ({CH}) is the major metabolite of {TCE} formed in the liver by cytochrome P450 2E1. {CH} is metabolized to the hepatocarcinogen trichloroacetate ({TCA}) by aldehyde dehydrogenase ({ALDH}) and to the noncarcinogenic metabolite trichloroethanol ({TCOH}) by alcohol dehydrogenase ({ADH}). {ALDH} and {ADH} are polymorphic in humans, and these polymorphisms are known  to affect the elimination of ethanol. It is therefore possible that polymorphisms in {CH} metabolism will yield subpopulations with greater than expected {TCA} formation with associated enhanced risk of liver tumors after {TCE} exposure. {METHODS}: The present studies were undertaken to determine the feasibility of using commercially available, cryogenically preserved human hepatocytes to determine simultaneously the kinetics of {CH} metabolism and {ALDH}/{ADH} genotype. Thirteen human hepatocyte samples were examined. Linear reciprocal plots were obtained for 11 {ADH} and 12 {ALDH} determinations. {RESULTS}: There was large interindividual variation in the Vmax values for both {TCOH} and {TCA} formation. Within this limited sample size, no correlation with {ADH}/{ALDH} genotype was apparent. Despite the large variation in Vmax values among individuals, disposition of {CH} into the two competing pathways was relatively constant. {CONCLUSIONS}: These data support the use of cryopreserved human hepatocytes as an  experimental system to generate metabolic and genomic information for incorporation into {TCE} cancer risk assessment models. The data are discussed with regard to cellular factors, other than genotype, that may contribute to the observed variability in metabolism of {CH} in human liver.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}: The effect of obesity on surgical outcome is becoming an increasingly relevant issue given the growing rate of obesity worldwide.
{OBJECTIVE}: To investigate the specific impact of obesity on pancreaticoduodenectomy.
{DESIGN}: A retrospective comparative study of a prospectively maintained database was carried out to investigate the specific impact of obesity on the technical aspects and postoperative outcome of pancreaticoduodenectomy.
{PATIENTS}: Between 1999 and 2006, 92 consecutive patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy using a standardized technique. The study population was subdivided according to the presence or absence of obesity.
{RESULTS}: Nineteen (20.7\%) patients were obese and 73 (79.3\%) patients were non-obese. The two groups were comparable in terms of demographics, American Society of Anesthesiology ({ASA}) score as well as nature and type of pancreatico-digestive anastomosis. The rate of clinically relevant pancreatic fistula (36.8\% vs. 15.1\%; P=0.050) and hospital stay (23.1+/-13.9 vs. 17.0+/-8.0 days; P=0.015) were significantly increased in obese vs. non-obese patients, respectively. Pancreatic fistula was responsible for one-half of the deaths (2/4) and two ruptured pseudoaneurysms. The incidence of the other procedure-related and general postoperative complications were not significantly different between the two groups. Intrapancreatic fat was increased in 10 obese patients (52.6\%) and correlated positively both with {BMI} (P=0.001) and with the occurrence of pancreatic fistula (P=0.003).
{CONCLUSION}: Obese patients are at increased risk for developing pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Special surgical caution as well as vigilant postoperative monitoring are therefore recommended in obese patients.},

	issn = {0022-5347},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Radical cystectomy has a significant rate of morbidity and it is important to elucidate the factors that contribute to this risk. Obesity is a major problem in the United States and is associated with increased health hazard. Morbid obesity may even preclude definitive surgical treatment. This study examines the impact of body mass index ({BMI}) on radical cystectomy.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Retrospective analysis was performed on 498 patients who underwent radical cystectomy primarily for bladder cancer from July 1, 1990 to May 10, 2002. Patient {BMI} was defined as normal (less than 25 in 151), overweight (25 to 29.9 in 198), obese (30 to 34.9 in 98) and morbidly obese (35 or greater in 51). The bivariate relationships among {BMI} categories and clinical parameters were assessed using the chi-square test, the analysis of variance and the log rank test. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox regression models.
{RESULTS}: Median followup for the cohort was 3.3 years. Mean {BMI} was 28 and 70 of the study group was above normal weight. Compared to normal {BMI}, upper weight {BMI} groups were younger (p {\textless}0.0001), and had increased estimated blood loss (p = 0.01) and operative time (p = 0.001). Complication number (p = 0.0004) was increased in these groups but complication severity was similar (p = 0.54). Morbidly obese patients underwent incontinent diversion more often (p = 0.03). In multivariate models increased {BMI} was independently associated with increased estimated blood loss (p = 0.004), prolonged operative time (p = 0.006) and increased complication rate (p = 0.01).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Increased {BMI} independently poses a greater perioperative risk to the patient and contributes to the technical challenge of the cystectomy. This is most appreciated in the morbidly obese population and likely contributes to a greater use of incontinent diversion in this group. The increased perioperative risk associated with elevated {BMI} is significant but not prohibitive and should not preclude cystectomy as definitive treatment.},

	abstract = {Three hundred ninety-three patients who were entered into pancreatic carcinoma treatment protocols of the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group ({GITSG}) were analyzed as to significant differences in clinical presentation and factors influencing survival. Patients were grouped according to the stage of the disease. Group I (21 cases) included those patients who had a potentially curative resection. Group {II} (182 cases) patients had a locally unresectable tumor less then 400 cm2 (surgically proven) and no distant metastases, and Group {III} (190 cases) had advanced disease. Group I patients had the smallest lesions (median area, 9 cm2), located in head of the gland in 90\% and painless jaundice was the most frequent clinical presentation (52\%). In Group {II}, 83\% were located in the head of the gland but the median area was much larger (36 cm2). Pain was present in 80\% of cases, and jaundice in 62\% with 48\% having jaundice and pain. In Group {III} patients, lesions of body and tail were over four-fold as frequent as in Group I and almost three-fold greater than in Group {II}. The median area of the lesion was large (30 cm2). Pain was present in 85\% and jaundice in only 31\%. Median survival in Group I patients was longer than Group {III} (73 versus 10 weeks; P less than 0.001). Ambulatory status, sex, race, abdominal pain, and histologic type influenced survival in one or more groups whereas age, jaundice, location of the tumor, degree of cellular differentiation, back pain, and nutritional status did not influence survival in any group. In all groups, those with a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [{ECOG}] 0 and 1) survived longer than those with poor status ({ECOG} 2 and 3; P less than 0.05). The best potential prognosis is in those who are fully productive and present with painless jaundice, and who have resection of the tumor.},

	abstract = {Background:
The aim of the study was to determine the association between short- and long-term outcomes and deprivation for patients undergoing operative treatment for colorectal cancer in the Northern Region of England.
Methods:
This was a retrospective analytical study based on the Northern Region Colorectal Cancer Audit Group database for the period 1998–2002. The Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, an area-based measure, was recalibrated and used to quantify deprivation. Patients were ranked based on their postcode of residence and grouped into five categories.
Results:
Of 8159 patients in total, 7352 (90·1 per cent) had surgery; 6953 (94·6 per cent) of the 7352 patients underwent tumour resection and 4935 (67·7 per cent) of 7294 had a margin-negative (R0) resection. Deprivation was not associated with age, sex, tumour site, stage or other tumour-related factors. Compared with the most affluent group, the most deprived patients had fewer elective operations (72·9 versus 76·4 per cent; P = 0·014), more adverse co-morbidity (P {\textless} 0·001) and fewer curative resections (65·5 versus 71·2 per cent; P {\textless} 0·001). In multivariable analysis, deprivation was not an independent predictor of postoperative death (odds ratio ({OR}) 0·72, 95 per cent confidence interval 0·48 to 1·06; P = 0·101) but it was a predictor of curative resection ({OR} 1·24, 1·01 to 1·52; P = 0·042), overall survival ({HR} 0·83, 0·73 to 0·95; P = 0·006) and relative survival ({HR} 0·74, 0·58 to 0·95; P = 0·023).
Conclusion:
Deprivation, both independently and by influencing other surgical predictors, impacts on short- and long-term outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer. Copyright © 2011 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Published by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Recently, there has been considerable interest in the potential impact of perioperative factors on long-term colorectal cancer outcome. Few studies have examined pre-, intra-, and  postoperative variables in a single cohort. {METHODS}: Four hundred and twenty-three patients with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer who underwent surgery with curative intent between 1997 and 2007 were included. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables were recorded. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of surgical complications and disease recurrence, respectively. {RESULTS}: The postoperative mortality rate was 4\% and the morbidity rate 34\%. The most important predictors of complications were smoking (odd ratio [{OR}] 1.32), {ASA} grade ({OR} 1.90) and {POSSUM} operative score ({OR} 1.32). During follow up (median 80 months), 35\% of patients developed disease recurrence. Predictors of recurrence, independent of tumor stage, were {POSSUM} physiology score (hazard ratio [{HR}] 1.31) and systemic inflammatory response ({HR} 1.31). {CONCLUSIONS}: Preoperative risk factors, but not postoperative complications, are associated with early disease recurrence after potentially curative resection of colorectal cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Higher body-mass index ({BMI}) has been implicated as a risk factor for developing pancreatic cancer, but its effect on survival has not been thoroughly investigated. The authors assessed the association of {BMI} with survival in a sample of pancreatic cancer patients and used epidemiologic and clinical information to understand the contribution of diabetes and hyperglycemia.
{METHODS}: A survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards by usual adult {BMI} was performed on 1861 unselected patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma; analyses were adjusted for covariates that included clinical stage, age, and sex. Secondary analyses incorporated self-reported diabetes and fasting blood glucose in the survival model.
{RESULTS}: {BMI} as a continuous variable was inversely associated with survival from pancreatic adenocarcinoma (hazard ratio [{HR}], 1.019 for each increased unit of {BMI} [kg/m2], P{\textless}.001) after adjustment for age, stage, and sex. In analysis by National Institutes of Health {BMI} category, {BMIs} of 30 to 34.99 kg/m2 ({HR}, 1.14; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.98-1.33), 35 to 39.99 kg/m2 ({HR} 1.32, 95\% {CI} 1.08-1.62), and ≥40 ({HR} 1.60, 95\% {CI} 1.26-2.04) were associated with decreased survival compared with normal {BMI} of 18.5 to 24.99 kg/m2 (overall trend test P{\textless}.001).

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The majority of patients with node-negative colorectal cancer have excellent 5-year survival prospects, but up to a third relapse. Strategies to identify patients at higher risk of adverse outcomes are desirable to enable optimal treatment and follow-up. The aim of this study was to examine postoperative mortality and longer-term survival by mode of presentation for patients with node-negative colorectal cancer undergoing surgery with curative intent. {METHODS}: Patients from 16 hospitals in the west of Scotland between 2001  and 2004 were identified from a prospectively maintained regional clinical audit  database. Postoperative mortality and 5-year relative survival by mode of presentation were recorded. {RESULTS}: Of 1,877 patients with node-negative disease, 251 (13.4\%) presented as an emergency. Those presenting as an emergency  were more likely to be older (P = 0.023), have colon rather than rectal cancer (P {\textless} 0.001), have {pT}4 stage disease (P {\textless} 0.001), have extramural vascular invasion (P = 0.001), and receive surgery under the care of a nonspecialist surgeon (P {\textless} 0.001) compared to those presenting electively. The postoperative mortality rate  was 3.3\% after elective and 12.8\% after emergency presentation (P {\textless} 0.001). Five-year relative survival was 91.8\% after elective and 66.8\% after emergency presentation (P {\textless} 0.001).

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}: Obesity has been implicated as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer.
{OBJECTIVE}: To demonstrate the association of excess body weight across an age cohort and the risk, age of onset, and overall survival of patients with pancreatic cancer.
{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: A case-control study of 841 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 754 healthy individuals frequency matched by age, race, and sex. The study was conducted at a university cancer center in the United States from 2004 to 2008. Height and body weight histories were collected by personal interview starting at ages 14 to 19 years and over 10-year intervals progressing to the year prior to recruitment in the study.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: The associations between patients' body mass index ({BMI}) and risk of pancreatic cancer, age at onset, and overall survival were examined by unconditional logistic regression, linear regression, and Cox proportional hazard regression models, respectively.
{RESULTS}: Individuals who were overweight (a {BMI} of 25-29.9) from the ages of 14 to 39 years (highest odds ratio [{OR}], 1.67; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.20-2.34) or obese (a {BMI} {\textgreater} or = 30) from the ages of 20 to 49 years (highest {OR}, 2.58; 95\% {CI}, 1.70-3.90) had an associated increased risk of pancreatic cancer, independent of diabetes status. The association was stronger in men (adjusted {OR}, 1.80; 95\% {CI}, 1.45-2.23) by mean {BMI} from the ages of 14 to 59 years than in women (adjusted {OR}, 1.32; 95\% {CI}, 1.02-1.70) and in ever smokers (adjusted {OR}, 1.75; 95\% {CI}, 1.37-2.22) than in never smokers (adjusted {OR}, 1.46; 95\% {CI}, 1.16-1.84). The population-attributable risk percentage of pancreatic cancer based on the mean {BMI} from the ages of 14 to 59 years was 10.3\% for never smokers and 21.3\% for ever smokers. Individuals who were overweight or obese from the ages of 20 to 49 years had an earlier onset of pancreatic cancer by 2 to 6 years (median age of onset was 64 years for patients with normal weight, 61 years for overweight patients [P = .02], and 59 years for obese patients [P {\textless} .001]). Compared with those with normal body weight and after adjusting for all clinical factors, individuals who were overweight or obese from the ages of 30 to 79 years or in the year prior to recruitment had reduced overall survival of pancreatic cancer regardless of disease stage and tumor resection status (overweight patients: hazard ratio, 1.26 [95\% {CI}, 0.94-1.69], P = .04; obese patients: hazard ratio, 1.86 [95\% {CI}, 1.35-2.56], P {\textless} .001).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Overweight or obesity during early adulthood was associated with a greater risk of pancreatic cancer and a younger age of disease onset. Obesity at an older age was associated with a lower overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.},

	volume = {223},
	issn = {0003-4932},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Tumor invasion of the superior mesenteric-portal vein ({SMPV}) confluence is often considered a contraindication to pancreaticoduodenectomy for patients with malignant tumors of the pancreas or periampullary region. The authors sought to determine whether pancreaticoduodenectomy with en bloc resection of the {SMPV} confluence could be safely performed and whether tumors involving the {SMPV} confluence were associated with pathologic parameters suggesting poor prognosis.
{SUMMARY} {BACKGROUND} {DATA}: Several centers have reported high rates of retroperitoneal margin positivity after pancreaticoduodenectomy for tumors of the pancreatic head and periampullary region. Positive-margin or incomplete resection is associated with early tumor recurrence and no survival benefit compared with palliative therapy. Tumor adherence to the lateral of posterior wall of the {SMPV} confluence often represents the only barrier to complete tumor resection at the time of pancreaticoduodenectomy.
{METHODS}: Data on all patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas or periampullary region over a 3.5-year period were entered prospectively in a pancreatic tumor database. To be considered for surgery, patients were required to fulfill the following computed tomography criteria for resectability: 1) the absence of extrapancreatic disease, 2) no tumor encasement of the superior mesenteric artery or celiac axis, and 3) a patent {SMPV} confluence. Tumor adherence to the superior mesenteric vein or {SMPV} confluence was assessed intraoperatively, and en bloc venous resection was performed when necessary to achieve complete tumor extirpation. Data on operative characteristics, morbidity, mortality, tumor size, nodal metastases, margin positivity, perineural invasion, and tumor {DNA} content were compared for patients who did and did not receive venous resection.
{RESULTS}: Fifty-nine patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, 36 without venous resection and 23 with en bloc resection of the {SMPV} confluence. No differences in median hospital stay, morbidity, mortality, tumor size, margin positivity, nodal positivity, or tumor {DNA} content were observed between groups.
{CONCLUSIONS}: When necessary, segmental resection of the {SMPV} confluence may be performed safely during pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary malignant tumors. Tumors invading the {SMPV} confluence are not associated with histologic parameters suggesting a poor prognosis. Our data suggest that venous involvement is a function of tumor location rather than an indicator of aggressive tumor biology.},

To identify risk factors for this complication and to delineate its impact on patient outcomes, we conducted a retrospective review of 1891 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy between 1981 and 2002. Overall, 216 patients (11.4\%) developed a postoperative pancreaticocutaneous fistula. In univariate analysis, gender, coronary disease, diabetes mellitus, operative times, blood loss, radical lymphadenectomy, gland texture, and specimen pathology correlated with fistula rates. In a multivariate model, however, only gland texture and coronary disease were statistically predictive. A soft gland was associated with a 22.6\% fistula rate, a 20.4-fold increase in fistula risk over those patients with a medium or firm gland (95\% confidence interval, 4.7-90.9). No patient with a firm gland developed a fistula. Although 30-day postoperative mortality was not different between those patients with and those without fistula (1.4\% versus 1.5\%), the mean length of stay was longer (26.0 days versus 13.2 days) and the rates of certain complications were increased in those patients with fistula. In this single-institution experience, pancreaticocutaneous fistula was most strongly predicted by pancreatic texture. Choice of anastomotic technique did not correlate with fistula rates. Pancreaticocutaneous fistula increases postoperative length of stay and morbidity but was not directly associated with increased postoperative mortality.},

{METHODS}: Since July 2006 consecutive patients from a single centre identified with a large (≥5.5 cm) {AAA} were sent for {CPET}. Follow-up was completed on 1 August 2009. Univariate logistical regression was used to compare {CPET} parameters with the Detsky score, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation ({APACHE}) {II} score and the Vascular Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the {enUmeration} of Mortality and morbidity ({VPOSSUM}) in predicting predefined early and late outcome measures.
{RESULTS}: Full data were available for 102 patients (93\% male, median age: 75 years, interquartile range ({IQR}): 70-80 years, median follow up: 28 months, {IQR}: 18-33 months). Ventilatory equivalents for oxygen and {APACHE} {II} predicted postoperative inotrope requirement (p=0.018 and p=0.019 respectively). The Detsky score predicted the length of stay in the intensive care unit (p=0.008). Mid-term (30-month) survival was predicted by the anaerobic threshold (p=0.02).
{CONCLUSIONS}: {CPET} provided the only means in this study of predicting both 30-day outcome and 30-month mortality. {CPET} could therefore become an increasingly important tool in determining the optimum management for {AAA} patients.},

Crude rates of morbidity and mortality can be misleading because such rates make no allowance for differences in case mix and fitness of patients. {AIM}: The aim of this study was to compare outcome among five surgeons by means of the simple, well-validated scoring system {POSSUM} for risk-adjusted analysis. {METHODS}: A total of 438 patients were studied prospectively. Each patient underwent colorectal resection by one of the five surgeons. Demographic details, operative procedure, and postoperative course were recorded, and physiologic and operative severity scores were determined. Risk of morbidity and mortality was calculated for each patient. {RESULTS}: Incidence of morbidity varied sharply among the five surgeons, from 13.6 to 30.6 percent, and the 30-day mortality varied from 4.5 to 6.9 percent. However, application of {POSSUM} to allow risk-adjusted analysis of the data demonstrated that the incidence of morbidity and mortality predicted by {POSSUM} based on patients physiologic and operative risks factors was very similar to the observed outcome for each surgeon. {CONCLUSION}: Direct comparison of individual surgeon's performance based on crude rates of morbidity and mortality can be misleading. Risk-adjusted analysis allows more meaningful comparison.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Clinical staging in patients with gastro-oesophageal cancer, is of crucial importance in determining the likely benefit of treatment. Despite recent advances in clinical staging, overall survival remains poor. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between pre-treatment clinical prognostic factors and cancer-specific survival. {METHODS}: Two hundred and seventeen patients, undergoing staging investigations including host factors (Edinburgh Clinical Risk Score ({ECRS})) and the systemic inflammatory response (Glasgow Prognostic score ({mGPS})), in the upper {GI} surgical unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, were studied. {RESULTS}: During the follow-up period, 188 (87\%) patients died; 178 of these patients died from the disease. The minimum follow-up was 46 months, and the median follow-up of the survivors was 65 months. On multivariate  survival analysis of the significant factors, only {cTNM} stage ({HR} 1.84, 95\% {CI} 1.56-2.17, p {\textless} 0.001), {mGPS} ({HR} 1.67, 95\% {CI} 1.35-2.07, p {\textless} 0.001) and treatment  ({HR} 2.12, 95\% {CI} 1.73-2.60, p {\textless} 0.001) were independently associated with survival. An elevated {mGPS} was associated with advanced {cTNM} stage, poor performance status, an elevated {ECRS} and more conservative treatment. {CONCLUSIONS}: Pre-treatment {mGPS} improves clinical staging in patients with gastro-oesophageal cancer. Therefore, it is likely to aid clinical decision making for these difficult to treat patients.},

	abstract = {Background
Prognosis after pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer is determined by tumor characteristics, completeness of resection, and patient's comorbidity. Our aim was to assess the effects of body mass and fat distribution on the postoperative course after pancreatoduodenectomy.
Methods
Of 2,968 pancreatic resections, 408 patients with primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy and of whom cross sectional images were available were identified and followed-up in a prospective database. Preoperative computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scans were analyzed for abdominal wall fat, hip girdle fat, visceral fat, and abdominal depth. Peri- and postoperative parameters, including preoperative unintentional weight loss, cachexia-associated serum parameters, nonoperative and operative complications, and mortality and long-term survival were evaluated and correlated with body mass index and fat distribution.
Results
Patients with low body mass index had a greater 90-day mortality (P = .048) and a trend toward greater complication rates and in-hospital mortality, despite a greater comorbidity in obese patients with a higher body mass index. Accordingly, patients with large amounts of abdominal wall fat had fewer intra-abdominal abscesses (P = .047), lower in-hospital (P = .019) and 90-day mortality rates (P = .007), and better long-term survival (P = .016).
Conclusion
In pancreatic cancer, underweight but not obese patients have a poor outcome after pancreatoduodenectomy. This observation emphasizes the need for pre- and perioperative therapeutic improvements in the setting of pancreatic cancer–associated cachexia.},

{DESIGN}: Randomized controlled pilot study.
{SETTING}: University rehabilitation facility.
{PARTICIPANTS}: Patients with small {AAA} (N=28; mean age ± {SD}, 72±7 y).
{INTERVENTION}: Participants were randomized to a 12-week program of moderate-intensity endurance exercise or standard care control (encouragement to exercise only).
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Safety was assessed in terms of the frequency of adverse events and changes in maximum {AAA} diameter. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks including cardiopulmonary fitness (ventilatory threshold), health-related quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey [version 2]), and markers of vascular risk (eg, blood pressure and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein).
{RESULTS}: Of 545 patients contacted, 28 (5\%) entered the trial. There were 3 (11\%) dropouts. Adherence to the exercise program was 94\%. There were no paradoxical increases in {AAA} size or adverse clinical events. Ventilatory threshold increased in the exercise group, but not the control group (adjusted mean difference, 2.5 {mL}·kg(-1)·min(-1); 95\% confidence interval, 0.5-4.5; d=.82). Systolic blood pressure and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein decreased in the exercise group compared with the control group (d=.34 and d=.58, respectively). There were no substantial changes in anthropometric variables or quality of life.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Despite a low recruitment rate, the findings suggest that moderate-intensity endurance exercise training is feasible in patients with small {AAA}, and can evoke improvements in important health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Patients with obstructive jaundice are susceptible to postoperative shock and kidney failure. The cause of these potentially fatal complications has not been fully clarified. The present study was designed to assess the role of myocardial dysfunction in the hemodynamic disturbance of obstructive jaundice. We studied the effect of isolated cholemia on left ventricular performance in five conscious dogs before and 2 weeks after choledochocaval anastomosis by using measurements of systolic time intervals ({STIs}) and maximal dp/dt. Mean left ventricular ejection tiem ({LVET}) decreased after cholemia from 159 +/- 2.8 msec to 139 +/- 2.6 msec (p less than 0.005), while mean preejection period ({PEP}) and mean {PEP}/{LVET} were increased from 41 +/- 8.5 msec to 87 +/- 14 msec (p less than 0.05) and from 0.39 +/- 0.06 to 0.62 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.01), respectively. During cholemia, {STIs} were unchanged after intravenous administration of ouabain, whereas in the control period, there was shortening of mean {PEP} from 71 +/- 8.8 msec to 58 +/- 7.6 msec (p less than 0.05) and of Q-S2 from 257 +/- 12 msec to 235 +/- 14 msec (p less than 0.005) in response to ouabain. Maximal dp/dt decreased after choledochocaval anastomosis from 4543 +/- 593 mm Hg/sec to 3666 +/- 648 mm Hg/sec (p less than 0.025). We conclude that cholemia in the dog is clearly associated with impaired left ventricular performance. The present data also support a previously published in vitro study from our laboratory showing that cholemia blunts the myocardial contractile response to sympathomimetic agents. The cardiodepressor effect of cholemia may explain the increased tendency of patients with obstructive jaundice to postoperative shock and renal failure.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Surgery in patients with obstructive jaundice caused by a periampullary (pancreas, papilla, distal bile duct) tumor is associated with a higher risk of postoperative complications than in non-jaundiced patients. Preoperative biliary drainage was introduced in an attempt to improve the general condition and thus reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality. Early studies showed a reduction in morbidity. However, more recently the focus has shifted towards the negative effects of drainage, such as an increase of infectious complications. Whether biliary drainage should always be performed in jaundiced patients remains controversial. The randomized controlled multicenter {DROP}-trial ({DRainage} vs. Operation) was conceived to compare the outcome of a 'preoperative biliary drainage strategy' (standard strategy) with that of an 'early-surgery' strategy, with respect to the incidence of severe complications (primary-outcome measure), hospital stay, number of invasive diagnostic tests, costs, and quality of life. {METHODS}/{DESIGN}: Patients with obstructive jaundice due to a periampullary tumor, eligible for exploration after staging with {CT} scan, and scheduled to undergo a "curative" resection, will be randomized to either "early surgical treatment" (within one week) or "preoperative biliary drainage" (for 4 weeks) and subsequent surgical treatment (standard treatment). Primary outcome measure is the percentage of severe complications up to 90 days after surgery. The sample size calculation is based on the equivalence design for the primary outcome measure. If equivalence is found, the comparison of the secondary outcomes will be essential in selecting the preferred strategy. Based on a 40\% complication rate for early surgical treatment and 48\% for preoperative drainage, equivalence is taken to be demonstrated if the percentage of severe complications with early surgical treatment is not more than 10\% higher compared to standard treatment: preoperative biliary drainage. Accounting for a 10\% dropout, 105 patients are needed in each arm resulting in a study population of 210 (alpha = 0.95, beta = 0.8). {DISCUSSION}: The {DROP}-trial is a randomized controlled multicenter trial that will provide evidence whether or not preoperative biliary drainage is to be performed in patients with obstructive jaundice due to a periampullary tumor.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}: Emerging data indicate that conventional cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. hypercholesterolemia and obesity) are paradoxically associated with better survival in distinct populations with wasting. We identify these populations and review survival paradoxes and common pathophysiologic mechanisms.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS}: A 'reverse epidemiology' of cardiovascular risk is observed in chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive lung disease, cancer, {AIDS} and rheumatoid arthritis, and in the elderly. These populations apparently have slowly progressive to full-blown wasting and significantly greater short-term mortality than the general population. The survival paradoxes may result from the time differential between the two competing risk factors [i.e. over-nutrition (long-term killer but short-term protective) versus undernutrition (short-term killer)]. Hemodynamic stability of obesity, protective adipokine profile, endotoxin-lipoprotein interaction, toxin sequestration of fat, antioxidation of muscle, reverse causation, and survival selection may also contribute.
{SUMMARY}: The seemingly counterintuitive risk factor paradox is the hallmark of chronic disease states or conditions associated with wasting disease at the population level. Studying similarities among these populations may help reveal common pathophysiologic mechanisms of wasting disease, leading to a major shift in clinical medicine and public health beyond the conventional Framingham paradigm and to novel therapeutic approaches related to wasting and short-term mortality.},

	abstract = {Background Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) is used to risk-stratify patients undergoing major elective surgery, with a poor exercise capacity being associated with an increased risk of complications and death. Patients with anaemia have a decreased exercise capacity and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality after major surgery. Blood transfusion is often used to correct anaemia in the perioperative period but the effect of this intervention on exercise capacity is not well described. We sought to measure the effect of blood transfusion on exercise capacity measured objectively with {CPET}.
Methods Patients with stable haematological conditions requiring blood transfusion underwent {CPET} before and 2–6 days after transfusion.
Results Twenty patients were enrolled and completed both pre- and post-transfusion tests. The mean (sd) haemoglobin (Hb) concentration increased from 8.3 (1.2) to 11.2 (1.4) g dl−1 after transfusion of a median (range) of 3 (1–4) units of packed red cells. The anaerobic threshold increased from a mean (sd) of 10.4 (2.4) to 11.6 (2.5) ml kg−1 min−1 (P=0.018), a mean difference of 1.2 ml kg−1 min−1 (95\% confidence interval ({CI})=0.2–2.2). When corrected for the change in Hb concentration, the anaerobic threshold increased by a mean (sd) of 0.39 (0.74) ml kg−1 min−1 per g dl−1 Hb.
Conclusions Transfusion of allogeneic packed red cells in anaemic adults led to a significant increase in their capacity to exercise. This increase was seen in the anaerobic threshold, and other {CPET} variables.},

A new method of prognosis in advanced cancer (combining performance status and {mGPS}) is tested and then validated. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: Two international biobanks of patients with advanced cancer were analyzed. Key prognostic factors [performance status, {PROs} (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life  Questionnaire C-30), and {mGPS} (using C-reactive protein and albumin concentrations)] were examined. The relationship between these and survival was examined using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods, in a test sample before independent validation. {RESULTS}: Data were available on 1,825 patients (test) and 631 patients (validation).

After endoscopic drainage significant reductions of hyperbilirubinaemia, indocyanine green retention and serum albumin concentration were observed. Patients with hilar lesions had a significantly higher incidence of cholangitis and failed endoscopic drainage after stent placement. The overall morbidity rate (18 patients versus 16) and mortality rate (six patients in each group) were similar in the two treatment arms irrespective of the level of biliary obstruction. Despite the improvement of liver function, routine application of endoscopic drainage had no demonstrable benefit.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Aerobic capacity and respiratory function may be compromised in obesity, but few studies have been done in highly obese bariatric candidates. In a prospective study, these variables were documented in the preoperative period, aiming to define possible physiologic limitations in a apparently healthy and asymptomatic population.
{METHOD}: Forty-six consecutively enrolled adults (age 39.6 +/- 8.4 years, 87.0\% females, body mass index /{BMI} 49.6 +/- 6.3 kg/m2) were analyzed. Ventilatory variables were investigated by automated spirometry, aerobic capacity was estimated by a modified Bruce test in an ergometric treadmill, and body composition was determined by bioimpedance analysis.
{RESULTS}: Total fat was greatly increased (46.4 +/- 4.6\% of body weight) and body water reduced (47.3 +/- 4.6 \% body weight), as expected for such obese group. Spirometric findings including forced vital capacity of 3.3 +/- 0.8 L and forced expiratory volume-1 second of 2.6 +/- 0.6 L were usually acceptable for age and gender, but mild restrictive pulmonary insufficiency was diagnosed in 20.9\%. Aerobic capacity was more markedly diminished, as reflected by very modest maximal time (4.5 +/- 1.1 min) and distance (322 +/-142 m) along with proportionally elevated maximal oxygen consumption (23.4 +/- 9.5 {mL}/kg/min) achieved by these subjects during test exercise.
{CONCLUSIONS}: 1) Cardiopulmonary evaluation was feasible and well-tolerated in this severely obese population; 2) Mean spirometric variables were not diminished in this study, but part of the population displayed mild restrictive changes; 3) Exercise tolerance was very negatively influenced by obesity, resulting in reduced endurance and excessive metabolic cost for the treadmill run; 4) More attention to fitness and aerobic capacity is recommended for seriously obese bariatric candidates;},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The benefits of preoperative biliary drainage, which was introduced to improve the postoperative outcome in patients with obstructive jaundice caused by a tumor of the pancreatic head, are unclear. {METHODS}: In this multicenter, randomized trial, we compared preoperative biliary drainage with surgery alone for patients with cancer of the pancreatic head. Patients with obstructive jaundice and a bilirubin level of 40 to 250 micromol per liter (2.3 to 14.6 mg per deciliter) were randomly assigned to undergo either preoperative biliary drainage for 4 to 6 weeks, followed by surgery, or surgery alone within 1 week after diagnosis. Preoperative biliary drainage was attempted primarily with the placement of an endoprosthesis by means of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The primary outcome was the rate of serious complications within 120 days after randomization. {RESULTS}: We enrolled 202 patients; 96 were assigned to undergo early surgery and 106 to undergo preoperative biliary drainage; 6 patients were excluded from the analysis. The rates of serious complications were 39\% (37 patients) in the early-surgery group and 74\% (75 patients) in the biliary-drainage group (relative risk in the early-surgery group, 0.54; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.41 to 0.71; P{\textless}0.001). Preoperative biliary drainage was successful in 96 patients (94\%) after one or more attempts, with complications in 47 patients (46\%).

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between components of the tumour inflammatory cell infiltrate and standard clinicopathological factors including hormone status (oestrogen receptor ({ER}), progesterone receptor  ({PR}) and human epidermal growth factor receptor ({HER})-2), Ki-67 and survival in patients with primary operable invasive ductal breast cancer. {METHODS}: Tumour inflammatory cell infiltrate, hormone status ({ER}, {PR} and {HER}-2), Ki-67 and standard clinicopathological factors were determined using routine pathological and immuno-histochemical techniques in 468 patients. {RESULTS}: The large majority  (94\%) of ductal tumours had evidence of inflammatory cell infiltrate. The general inflammatory cell infiltrate was positively associated with high grade (P{\textless}0.001), the absence of {ER} (P{\textless}0.001), the absence of {PR} (P{\textless}0.01), the presence of vascular invasion (P{\textless}0.05) and high lymphocytic infiltrate, plasma cell infiltrate, other  inflammatory cell infiltrate and macrophage infiltrate (all P{\textless}0.001). The median  follow-up of the survivors was 165 months. During this period, 93 patients died of their cancer. On univariate analysis, stratified for {ER} status, tumour size (P{\textless}0.01), lymph node involvement (P{\textless}0.001), tumour plasma cell infiltrate (P{\textless}0.001), other inflammatory cell infiltrate (P{\textless}0.05) and treatment (P{\textless}0.05) were associated with poorer cancer-specific survival whereas lymphocyte infiltrate (P{\textless}0.001) was associated with improved cancer-specific survival. On multivariate analysis, stratified for {ER} status, lymph node involvement (P{\textless}0.05)  was independently associated with poorer cancer-specific survival whereas increased tumour lymphocyte infiltrate (P{\textless}0.001) was independently associated with improved cancer-specific survival. {CONCLUSION}: The results of this study show that, using routine histology, the general inflammatory cell infiltrate was  a common feature and was positively associated with high grade, the absence of {ER}, the absence of {PR}, the presence of vascular invasion and high-grade infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells, other inflammatory cells and macrophages. Also, that within a mature cohort of patients, a high lymphocytic infiltrate was associated with improved survival, independent of clinicopathological characteristics including {ER} status, in primary operable ductal invasive breast cancer. These results rationalise previous work and provide a sound basis for future studies in this important area of breast cancer  research.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Preoperative biliary stenting is associated with bacterial contamination of bile and an increased rate of infectious complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Preoperative drainage has been found to have conflicting effects on morbidity and mortality, and no studies have been published on the effect of stent complications and duration of stenting on postoperative outcome. This study examined the effects of preoperative biliary stenting on early outcome after pancreaticoduodenectomy. {METHODS}: Details of 144 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy from 1992 to 2001 were entered into a database. Variables included biliary stenting, duration of stenting, stent complications and bile culture results. Details of surgery and postoperative complications were noted. Patients were grouped as stented and non-stented. Factors likely to affect postoperative mortality and morbidity were analysed. {RESULTS}: Preoperative biliary stenting was performed in 74 of the 144 patients; post-stenting complications developed in 18 patients (24 per cent) before surgery. After surgery there were nine deaths (6.3 per cent) and 60 (41.7 per cent) of the 144 patients developed complications, with no significant difference in morbidity rate between stented and non-stented patients. Logistic regression showed that a positive intraoperative bile culture was the only factor significantly associated with operative morbidity (P {\textless} 0.001) and mortality (P = 0.019). Biliary stenting was not significantly associated with a positive culture (P = 0.073), but stenting that resulted in complications (P = 0.006) and drainage for less than 6 weeks (P = 0.011) was associated with significantly greater culture positivity. Stenting followed by complications was shown by logistic regression to be the only factor significantly associated with a positive culture (P = 0.012). {CONCLUSION}: A positive intraoperative bile culture was associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates following pancreaticoduodenectomy. A positive culture in the stented group was related to stent complications and duration of stenting. Uncomplicated stenting was not associated with increased morbidity or mortality.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Maintenance of postinjury T-lymphocyte immune paralysis or anergy could result from failure to activate costimulatory receptors during T-cell receptor activation and/or from chronic stimulation of a competing set of elevated corepressor receptors. Our objective was to assess whether elevated posttrauma T-lymphocyte surface expression of corepressor receptors was associated with immunodepressed lymphocyte responses and corresponded to increased inhibitory and decreased activating signal transduction molecules.
{DESIGN}: Prospective observational study.
{SETTING}: University trauma intensive care unit and research laboratory.
{PATIENTS}: Sixty-one severe thermal and mechanical trauma patients.
{INTERVENTIONS}: None.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Isolated trauma patients' and controls' peripheral blood T cells were assayed for negative and positive costimulation receptor expression. These receptor expression levels were compared (flow cytometry) between the two groups and correlated to T-cell levels of inhibitory and activating signal transduction molecules and proliferation capacity. Patients' proliferation hyporesponsive (anergic) T cells had increased expression of novel inhibitory receptors (corepressors) {PD}-1 (p {\textless} .05) and {CD}47 (p {\textless} .05) vs. patients' T-cell proliferation competent or controls' T cells. Patients' T-cell {CD}152 ({CTLA}-4) expression was also elevated vs. controls. Only patients' anergic T cells had simultaneously increased levels of the inhibitory signal transduction proteins, c-Cbl, a ubiquitin-ligase (p {\textless} .01) and {SHP}-1, a phosphatase (p {\textless} .01), concomitant to depressed phosphorylation of the activating signal kinases Erk, Zap70, and {CD}3Euro. T-cell receptor complex phosphorylation and activation of the interleukin-2 pivotal transcriptional complex protein {CREB} were also simultaneously depressed as c-Cbl and {SHP}-1 were elevated.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Up-regulated corepressor receptor expression is novelly shown to characterize trauma patients' anergic T cells and correlate with predominance of inhibitory overactivating signal transduction molecules during T-cell stimulation. This could contribute to postinjury immunosuppression.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Obesity has previously been shown to correlate with higher stage and decreased survival in pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of obesity on operative outcomes, recurrence, and overall survival.
{METHODS}: A review of our 1345 patient prospective hepatopancreaticobiliary database was performed to identify patients undergoing pancreatic resection from January 1991 to August 2008 for adenocarcinoma. Obesity was defined as a body mass index ({BMI}) {\textgreater} 30 kg/m(2). Data was analyzed using Wilcoxon, t test, and chi-square methods. Survival was analyzed using log-rank analysis. Postoperative complications were assessed using a 5-point scale. P {\textless} .05 was considered significant.
{RESULTS}: Of 306 patients undergoing pancreatic resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma examined, 68 were defined as obese. There was no significant difference seen in length of stay, operative time, tumor size, or node status. Obese patients had a higher operative blood loss (median 650 vs. 400 {mL}, P = .0008). Obese patients were more likely to suffer postoperative complications (67.6\% vs. 50.4\%, P = .01). There was no significant difference seen in disease-free survival or overall survival (22.1 months for obese vs. 25.6 months for nonobese, P = .5; 19.8 months for obese vs. 23.5 months for nonobese, P = .46).
{CONCLUSION}: Obese patients had a higher rate and greater severity of postoperative complications, with increased operative blood loss. However, obese patients did not demonstrate any significant difference in specific oncologic factors or survival. These data suggest an equivalent biologic effect of obesity on pancreatic cancer survival.},

	abstract = {The ability of the cardiorespiratory system (heart, lungs, blood) to deliver oxygen to exercising skeletal muscle constrains maximum oxygen consumption V˙O2max, with cardiac output and the concentration of oxygen-carrying haemoglobin ([Hb]) being key limiting parameters. Total blood volume ({BV}) is the sum of the plasma volume ({PV}) and the total red cell volume. The measured [Hb] is dependent upon the total circulating mass of haemoglobin ({tHb}-mass) and plasma volume ({PV}). While the proportion of oxygen carried in plasma is trivial (0.3 {mL} of oxygen per 100 {mL} of plasma), each gram of Hb, contained in red blood cells, binds 1.39 {mL} of oxygen. As a result, the relationship between V˙O2max and {tHb}-mass is stronger than that observed between V˙O2max and [Hb] or {BV}. The glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin drives red cell synthesis and, like simple transfusion of packed red blood cells, can increase {tHb}-mass. An iron-containing haem group lies at the centre of the Hb molecule and, in situations of actual or functional iron deficiency, {tHb}-mass will also rise following iron administration. However achieved, an increase in {tHb}-mass also increases circulating oxygen-carrying capacity, and thus the capacity for aerobic phosphorylation. It is for such reasons that alterations in V˙O2max and exercise performance are proportional to those in arterial oxygen content and systemic oxygen transport, a change in {tHb}-mass of 1 g being associated with a 4 {mL} · min−1 change in V˙O2max. Similarly, V˙O2max increases by approximately 1\% for each 3 g · L−1 increase in [Hb] over the [Hb] range (120 to 170 g · L−1). Surgery, like exercise, places substantial metabolic demands on the patient. Whilst subject to debate, oxygen supply at a rate inadequate to prevent muscle anaerobiosis may underpin the occurrence of the anaerobic threshold ({AT}), an important submaximal marker of cardiorespiratory fitness. Preoperatively, cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) can be used to determine {AT} and peak exertional oxygen uptake (V˙O2 peak) as measures of ability to meet increasing oxygen demands. The degree of surgical insult and the ability to meet the resulting additional postoperative oxygen demand appear to be fundamental determinants of surgical outcome: individuals in whom such ability is impaired (and thus those with reduced V˙O2 peak and {AT}) are at greater risk of adverse surgical outcome. This review provides an overview of the relationships between [Hb], {tHb}-mass, exercise capacity, and surgical outcome and discusses the potential value of assessing {tHb}-mass over [Hb].},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Poor condition at operation determined by the physiologic {POSSUM} score is related to postoperative mortality and morbidity of colorectal cancer surgery. This study was designed to analyze the relationship between condition of patients with colorectal cancer at operation and long-term overall survival. {METHODS}: A total of 542 patients survived a radical resection for Stages I, {II}, or {III} colorectal cancer. Physiologic {POSSUM} score at surgery, exclusive of age, was calculated for all patients. Mean physiologic {POSSUM} score was used as cutoff point to determine low-risk and high-risk group patients. A Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to study the effect of low-risk and high-risk group on overall survival and to identify independent risk factors. {RESULTS}: Five-year overall survival was significantly higher in low-risk group patients than in high-risk group patients (low-risk group 66.6 percent vs. high-risk group 48.5 percent; P {\textless} 0.001). Differences in overall survival also were found when patients in Stages I, {II}, and {III} were analyzed separately. Risk factors for overall survival were advanced stage of disease, poor tumor differentiation, mucinous adenocarcinoma, older than age 70 years, and poor condition of the patient at time of operation. {CONCLUSIONS}: Poor condition at operation, as determined by physiologic {POSSUM} score, is a risk indicator for long-term overall survival in colorectal cancer patients.},

Chronic pancreatitis, although lower in incidence, significantly reduces patients' quality of life. Pancreatic cancer is associated with a high mortality rate and is one of the top 5 causes of death from cancer. The burden of pancreatic disorders is expected to increase over time. The risk and etiology of pancreatitis differ with age and sex, and all pancreatic disorders affect the black population more than any other race. Gallstones are the most common cause of acute pancreatitis, and early cholecystectomy eliminates the risk of future attacks. Alcohol continues to be the single most important risk factor for chronic pancreatitis. Smoking is an independent risk factor for acute and chronic pancreatitis, and its effects could synergize with those of alcohol. Significant risk factors for pancreatic cancer include smoking and non-O blood groups. Alcohol abstinence and smoking cessation can alter the progression of pancreatitis and reduce recurrence; smoking cessation is the most effective strategy to reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer.},

Obesity predicts the incidence of and poor outcomes from pancreatic cancer. Obesity has also been linked to surgical complications in pancreatectomy, including increased length of hospital stay, surgical infections, blood loss, and decreased survival. However, {BMI}'s impact on many complications following pancreatectomy remains controversial.
{METHODS}: We performed a {MEDLINE} search of all combinations of "{BMI}" with "pancreatectomy," "pancreatoduodenectomy," or "pancreaticoduodenectomy." From included studies, we created pooled and weighted estimates for quantitative and qualitative outcomes. We used the {PRISMA} criteria to ensure this project's validity.
{RESULTS}: Our primary cohort included 2,736 patients with {BMI} {\textless}30, 1,682 with {BMI} {\textgreater}25, and 546 with {BMI} between 25 and 30. Most outcomes showed no definitive differences across {BMIs}. Pancreatic fistula ({PF}) rates ranged from 4.7\% to 31.0\%, and four studies found multivariate association between {BMI} and {PF} (range odds ratio 1.6-4.2). Pooled analyses of {PF} by {BMI} showed significant association (p {\textless} 0.05).
{CONCLUSION}: {BMI} increases the operative complexity of pancreatectomy. However, with aggressive peri- and post-operative care, increases in {BMI}-associated morbidity and mortality may be mitigated.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Infective complications particularly in the form of surgical site infections including anastomotic leak represent a serious morbidity after colorectal cancer surgery. Systemic inflammation markers, including C-reactive protein ({CRP}) and white cell count, have been reported to provide early detection. However, their relative predictive value is unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine the diagnostic accuracy of serial postoperative {WCC}, albumin and {CRP} in detecting infective complications. {METHODS}: White cell count,  albumin and {CRP} were measured postoperatively for 7 days in 454 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. All postoperative complications were recorded. The diagnostic accuracy of the white cell count, albumin and {CRP} values were analyzed by receiver operating characteristics curve  analysis with surgical site infective complications as outcome measures. {RESULTS}: One hundred four patients (23 \%) developed infective complications, and 26 of them developed an anastomotic leak. {CRP} was most sensitive to the development of  an infective complication, surgical site or at a remote site. On postoperative day 3 {CRP} the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.80 (p  {\textless} 0.001) and the optimal cutoff value was 170 mg/L.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The introduction of the bowel cancer screening programme has resulted in increasing numbers of patients being diagnosed with node-negative disease. Unfortunately, approximately 30 \% will develop recurrence following surgery. Given the toxicity associated with adjuvant chemotherapy, it is important to identify high-risk patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapy. This study aims to identify which clinicopathological factors and genetic profiling markers  predict outcome in node-negative disease. {METHODS}: Forty-nine microsatellite stable ({MSS}) patients undergoing curative resection between 1991 and 1993 were included. Local immune response was assessed by Klintrup criteria and vascular invasion status assessed through Miller's elastin staining. Comparative genomic hybridisation ({CGH}) on a range of loci provided data on allelic imbalance. Analysis of survival included clinicopathological and {CGH} data in a multivariate  (Cox) model. {RESULTS}: On binary logistical regression analysis, 4p deletion was independently associated with low Klintrup score ({HR} 0.16; 95 \% {CI} (0.03-0.96); P = 0.045), venous invasion ({HR} 4.19; 95 \% {CI} (1.08-16.29); P = 0.039) and higher Dukes' stage ({HR} 6.43; 95 \% {CI} (1.22-33.97); P = 0.028).

Divicine has long been thought to be a mediator of an acute hemolytic crisis, known as favism, in susceptible individuals who ingest fava beans (Vicia faba). However, a recent report has questioned the chemical identity of the divicine that was used in most of the studies on divicine hemotoxicity. The present study was undertaken to examine the hemolytic potential of synthetic divicine. Divicine was synthesized and its identity and purity were  confirmed by {HPLC}, mass spectrometry, and {NMR} spectroscopy. The stability and redox behavior of divicine, under physiological conditions, were examined by {HPLC} and cyclic voltammetry. The data indicate that divicine is readily oxidized under aerobic conditions; however, it was sufficiently stable at {pH} 7.4 to permit its experimental manipulation. When 51Cr-labeled rat erythrocytes were exposed in vitro to the parent glucoside, vicine (5 {mM}), and then readministered to rats, no decrease in erythrocyte survival was observed. In contrast, erythrocyte survival  was dramatically reduced by in vitro exposure to divicine (1.5 {mM}). These data demonstrate that divicine is a direct-acting hemolytic agent and thus may be a mediator of the hemolytic crisis induced by fava bean ingestion.},

The mean {APACHE} {II} score on the day of admission was 16.1 (range 8-35). All patients required operative therapy. Among the 340 patients, 270 (79.4\%) had to be reoperated: 196 patients (72.6\%) underwent operative revisions on demand, and 74 (27.4\%) patients had preplanned reoperation. The overall mortality was 39.1\% (133 patients). Septic organ failure in 126 patients (37.1\%) and myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism in 7 patients (2\%) were the causes of death. The patient's age (p {\textless} 0.0002), {APACHE} {II} scores at admission (p {\textless} 0.0001), presence or development of (single or multiple) organ failure (p {\textless} 0.002), infection (p {\textless} 0.02) and extent (p {\textless} 0.04) of pancreatic necrosis, and surgical control of local necrosis (p {\textless} 0.0001) significantly determined survival. {SAP} that requires surgical treatment is associated with high in-hospital mortality. Surgical control of local necrosis is the precondition for survival.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {STUDY} {AIMS}: An analysis of the diagnosis difficulties in periampullary carcinoma ({PAC}) is done, the consequences being the possible therapeutically insufficiencies. {PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: During 10 years (1990-1998) 54 patients have been operated on for a {PAC}. Sex ratio: 34 males (63\%)/20 females (37\%). The pick of frequency was in the decade 61-70 years (20 patients) with extremes ages between 20 and 80 years. The main symptom was the cholestatic progressive jaundice with or without neoplasic pain (39 patients–72\%). The intermittent jaundice was present only to 7 patients (13\%) and the clinical forms without jaundice were manifested to other 8 (15\%); superaded colangitic syndrome was present to 17 patients (31\%). Other concomitances manifestations of the neoplasic disease were record to 23 cases (43\%). Historical evolution of the illness until the cholestatic jaundice appearance was under 2 month to 23 cases, between 2 and 4 months to 24 patients and not sure determined to other 8. The biological preoperative investigations confirmed the clinically evident biliary retention syndrome in 85\% of the cases and not yet clinically visible to other 15\% of the cases. The ultrasonography was the most conclusive method from the imaging examinations because it have suggested the diagnostic of {PAC} to 43.5\% from the patients submitted to this exploration. Computed tomography was diagnosis relevant only for the in site-regional invasion of the tumors or for the nodes or systemic metastases. Endoscopy and the endobiopsy proved to be valuable especially associated with {ERCP} (our experience regarding {ERCP} is not conclusive yet). Therefore the real preoperative diagnostic was established to 11 patients (20\%), and for the rest of the cases there have been another presumptive preoperative diagnosis: cancer of the pancreatic head (11 patients), retentive jaundice without determined origin (24 patients), others (8 patients). Intraoperative exploration detected the periampullary tumor through palpation in 30 (55\%) cases, through palpation and exploratory duodenectomy in 8 (15\%) cases and/or by accessory signs (hydropic gallbladder, dilatation of the main biliary duct etc.). Organic metastases or duodenal stenosis was present in nine cases (6 with nodes metastases). The practiced surgery was: Whipple operations (in one–the majority–or two steps)–35 cases (65\%); palliative surgery for biliary drainage 16 (30\%) cases; others 3 (6\%) cases. The postoperative staging of {pT} parameter (in situ or ex situ dimensional determined) reveled: {pT}1-12 patients; {pT}2–9 patients; {pT}3–14 patients; {pT}4–19 patients. Histopathological examinations confirmed the diagnostic of periampullary adenocarcinoma (32 patients) or carcinoma (3 patients) for the 35 patients with resectional operations. The determination of the tissular origin of the periampullary tumor was initially possible only in 11 (31\%) operative specimens. A secondary study with many repeated sections in the wax included blocks specified the histogenesis of the tumors to other 10 patients, therefore for a total of 21 cases. We think that this histogenetically diagnosis aspect is important only for some predictive appreciations regarding the outcome of the operated patients and not for the elected therapeutically surgical method. {RESULTS}: The globally perioperative mortality was 8 (15\%) patients. Three from this deceased were a consequence of palliative surgery applied to patients with advanced stages of neoplasic disease. The medium outcome for patients submitted to Whipple operation–in course of evaluation–is between 32 and 41 months to the patients which we can followed. For the patients with palliative operations the same distant survival is between 12 and 24 months.},

In chronic pancreatitis the standardised incidence ratio for development of pancreatic cancer is 14-18 and is further increased by cigarette smoking.

In patients who develop pancreatic cancer, there is interest in the role of the inflammatory response in  the development of cancer cachexia and in determining prognosis. Furthermore, markers of a systemic inflammatory response have prognostic significance in both  advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer and in patients undergoing resection.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Studies have indicated that hypoalbuminemia is associated with decreased survival of patients with gastric cancer. However, the prognostic value of albumin may be secondary to an ongoing systemic inflammatory response. The aim of the study was to assess the relation between hypoalbuminemia, the systemic inflammatory response, and survival in patients with gastric cancer. {METHODS}: Patients diagnosed with gastric carcinoma attending the upper gastrointestinal surgical unit in the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow between April 1997 and December 2005 and who had a pretreatment measurement of albumin and C-reactive protein ({CRP}) were studied. {RESULTS}: Most of the patients had stage {III}/{IV} disease and received palliative treatment. The minimum follow-up was 15 months. During follow-up, 157 (72\%) patients died of their cancer. On univariate analysis, stage (p {\textless} 0.001), treatment (p {\textless} 0.001), albumin level (p {\textless} 0.001), and {CRP} level (p {\textless} 0.001) were significant predictors of survival. On multivariate analysis, stage (p {\textless} 0.001), treatment (p {\textless} 0.001), and {CRP} level (p {\textless} 0.001) remained significant predictors of survival. Albumin was no longer an independent predictor of survival. {CONCLUSIONS}: Low albumin concentrations are associated with poorer survival in patients with gastric cancer. However, the strength of this relation with survival is dependent on the presence of a systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by an elevated {CRP} level. Therefore, it appears that the relation between hypoalbuminemia and poor survival is secondary  to that of the systemic inflammatory response.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis may result in significant morbidity and mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis. Many recommendations have been made for management of necrotizing pancreatitis, but no published guidelines have incorporated the many recent developments in minimally invasive techniques for necrosectomy. Hence, a multidisciplinary conference was convened to develop a consensus on interventions for necrotizing pancreatitis. Participants included most international experts from multiple disciplines. The evidence for efficacy of interventions was reviewed, presentations were given by experts, and a consensus was reached on each topic. In summary, intervention is primarily indicated for infected necrosis, less often for symptomatic sterile necrosis, and should ideally be delayed as long as possible, preferably 4 weeks or longer after the onset of disease, for better demarcation and liquefaction of the necrosis. Both the step-up approach using percutaneous drainage followed by minimally invasive video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement and per-oral endoscopic necrosectomy have been shown to have superior outcomes to traditional open necrosectomy with respect to short-term and long-term morbidity and are emerging as treatments of choice. Applicability of these techniques depends on the availability of specialized expertise and a multidisciplinary team dedicated to the management of severe acute pancreatitis and its complications.},

It is crucial to know the incidence, etiology and clinical features of {ARF} to promote prevention strategies and to implement adequate resources for the management of this entity. During a nine month period, a collaborative prospective protocol with 98 variables was developed to assess all {ARF} episodes encountered in the 13 tertiary-care hospitals in Madrid, Spain (covering 4.2 million people of over 14 years of age). {ARF} was considered when a sudden rise in serum creatinine concentration (S-Cr) to more than 177 mu mol/liter was found in patients with normal renal function, or when the sudden rise (50\% or more) was observed in patients with previous mild-to-moderate chronic renal failure (S-Cr {\textless} 264 mu mol/liter). Of the 748 cases of {ARF} studied, 665 episodes presented in inhabitans from the Madrid area. This gives an overall incidence of {ARF} of 209 cases per million population (p.m.p.; 95\% Ci 195 to 223). The incidence of acute tubular necrosis ({ATN}) was 88 cases p.m.p. (95\% {CI} 79 to 97), prerenal {ARF} 36 p.m.p (95\% {CI} 40 to 52), acute-onset chronic {ARF} 29 p.m.p. (95\% {CI} 24 to 34), and obstructive {ARF} 13 p.m.p. (95\% {CI} 19 to 27). The mean age was 63 +/- 17 years. The most frequent causes of {ARF} were {ATN} (45\%), prerenal (21\%), acute-onset chronic renal failure (12.7\%) and obstructive {ARF} (10\%). Renal function was normal at admission in 48\% of patients who later developed {ARF}. Mortality (35\%) was much higher than that of the other patients admitted (5.4\%, P {\textless} 0.001). This real outcome correlated extremely well with the expected outcome calculated through out the severity index of {ARF} ({SI}) 0.433 +/- 0.246 (mean +/- {SD}). In 187 cases, mortality was attributed to underlying disease, thus corrected mortality due to {ARF} was 26.7\%. Dialysis was required in 36\% of patients. and was associated with a significantly higher {SI} of {ARF} (0.57 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.19, P {\textless} 0.001) and mortality (65.9 vs. 33.2\%, P {\textless} 0.001). Mortality in patients hemodialyzed with biocompatible synthetic membranes (N = 50) was similar to that observed with cellulosic ones (N = 84; 66\% vs. 59.5\%, {NS}). Mortality was higher in patients with coma, assisted respiration, hypotension, jaundice (all P {\textless} 0.001) and oliguria (P {\textless} 0.02). This study gives, for the first time, the incidence of all forms of {ARF} in a developed country. {ARF} is iatrogenically induced at a high rate by modern medicine.

	abstract = {{AbstractBackground}
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the {UK}, with patients suffering declines in muscle mass and aerobic function. We hypothesised that tumour removal in non-metastatic colorectal cancer would lead to a restoration of lean muscle mass and increases in objective and subjective measures of aerobic performance.
Methods
We recruited two groups: patients with colorectal cancer (n = 30, 65.3 (51–77) y, body mass index 27.67 (4.83) kg m−2) and matched controls (n = 30, 64.6 (42–77) y, {BMI} 27.14 (3.51) kg m−2). Controls underwent a single study while colorectal cancer patients were studied before and 10 months after tumour resection. Aerobic performance was assessed via cardiopulmonary exercise testing and activity questionnaires. Lean muscle mass was measured via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
Results
Lean muscle mass was not different between groups (control: 47.82 (8.23); pre-resection: 52.41 (10.59); post-resection: 52.38 (10.52), kg). Anaerobic threshold was lower in pre-operative patients compared to controls (14.40 (3.23) vs. 19.67 (5.81) ml kg−1 min−1, p \&lt; 0.0001), increasing significantly post-resection (17.00 (3.56) ml kg−1 min−1 p \&lt; 0.0001). Self reported maximal physical activity was lower after resection compared to preoperatively (pre-resection 6.0 (6.5–5 {IQR}), post-resection 3.75 (4–3 {IQR}), p \&lt; 0.0001).
Conclusion
In colorectal cancer, anaerobic threshold is reached more rapidly than in matched controls, returning toward normal with tumour resection. Self-reported measures of activity do not mirror this objective change, cardiopulmonary exercise testing may therefore allow for a more accurate evaluation of pre and postoperative performance capability. The variance between objective and subjective measures of exercise capacity may be important in determining return to normal activities.},

	abstract = {{STUDY} {DESIGN}: This is a prospective observational study of erythrocyte sedimentation rate ({ESR}) and C-reactive protein ({CRP}) in a cohort of patients undergoing spinal surgery.
{OBJECTIVE}: We sought to characterize the normal kinetics of {ESR} and {CRP} after spinal surgery and compare their usefulness as predictors of infectious complications in the early postoperative period.
{SUMMARY} {OF} {BACKGROUND} {DATA}: {ESR} and {CRP} are nonspecific markers of inflammation used to evaluate postoperative infection. {CRP} is a quantitative test that exhibits predictable kinetics consisting of a postoperative rise and a peak followed by a decrease toward the normal value. Deviation from normal kinetics may be an indicator of infection.
{METHODS}: {ESR} and {CRP} were collected before surgery and daily after surgery in consecutive patients. All infectious complications were recorded.
{RESULTS}: One hundred forty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Infectious complications occurred in 20 patients. A postoperative peak, which is necessary to apply the test, was observed in 78\% of patients for {CRP} and 48\% for {ESR}. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed preoperative {CRP}, number of levels, and lumbar region as significant predictors of greater {CRP} peak value (r = 0.435, P = 0.001). After the peak, {CRP} showed an exponential decrease with a half-life of 2.6 days (r = 0.701, P {\textless} 0.001). No trend could be determined for {ESR}. A second rise or failure to decrease as expected had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 82\%, 48\%, 41\%, and 86\% for infectious complications, respectively. Of 8 cases of deep wound infection, 7 exhibited substantial deviations from expected {CRP} values.
{CONCLUSION}: {CRP} is more applicable, predictable, and responsive in the early postoperative period compared with {ESR}. The postoperative kinetics of {CRP} derived in this study seems to be conserved regardless of operation, magnitude, or region. Knowledge of the kinetics allows assessment of the degree of difference between actual and expected values. Using a second rise or failure to decrease as expected for {CRP} is sensitive for infection. A negative test is reassuring that infection is unlikely.},

	abstract = {From 1960 to 1992 a total of 1718 patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma were recorded. Of these patients, 469 (27.3\%) underwent hepatic resection, which was performed with curative intent in 434 patients (25.3\%). Operative mortality in this group was 4.4\%, being 1.8\% (2 of 114) during the last 3 years. Significant morbidity was observed in 16\% of patients with a decrease to 5\% (6 of 112) for the last 3 years. A 99.8\% follow-up until November 1, 1993 was achieved. Excluding operative mortality, there are 350 patients with “potentially curative” resection and 65 corresponding patients with minimal macroscopic (n=19) or microscopic (n=46) residual disease. The latter group demonstrated a poor prognosis, with median and maximum survival times of 14.4 and 56.0 months, respectively. Among the 350 patients having potentially curative resection, the actuarial 5-, 10-, and 20-year survivals were 39.3\%, 23.6\%, and 17.7\%, respectively. Tumor-free survival was 33.6\% at 5 years. In the univariate analysis, the following factors were associated with decreased crude survival: presence and extent of mesenteric lymph node involvement (p=0.0001); grade {III}/{IV} primary tumor (p=0.013); synchronous diagnosis of metastases (p=0.014); satellite metastases (p=0.00001); metastasis diameter of{\textgreater}5 cm (p=0.003); preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen ({CEA}) elevation (p=0.03); limited resection margins (p=0.009); extrahepatic disease (p=0.009); and nonanatomic procedures (p=0.008). With respect to disease-free survival, extrahepatic disease (p=0.09) failed to achieve statistical significance, whereas patients with primary tumors in the colon did significantly better than those with rectal cancer (p=0.04). The presence of five or more independent metastases adversely affected resectability (p{\textless}0.05). However, once a radical excision of all detectable disease was achieved, no significant predictive value of an increasing number of metastases (1–3 versus≥4) on either overall (p=0.40) or disease-free (p=0.64) survival was found. Using Cox's multivariate regression analysis, the presence of satellite metastases, primary tumor grade, the time of metastasis diagnosis diameter of the largest metastasis, anatomic versus nnanatomic approach, year of resection, and mesenteric lymph node involvement each independently affected both crude and tumor-free survival.},

	abstract = {Obesity has generally been thought to increase the risk of operative mortality and postoperative complications in surgical patients. No data examining obesity as a factor in cadaveric renal transplantation were available. We therefore matched obese patients undergoing cadaveric renal transplantation with nonobese control patients and retrospectively analyzed mortality, morbidity, and graft survival in each group. Patients were matched for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, {PRA}, graft number, cardiovascular disease, date of transplantation, and posttransplant immunosuppression. There were significant differences found in mortality (11\% in obese vs. 2\% in nonobese patients, P less than or equal to 0.01), immediate graft function (38\% in obese vs. 64\% in nonobese patients, P less than or equal to 0.01), 1-year graft survival (66\% in obese vs. 84\% in nonobese patients, P less than or equal to 0.05), and postoperative complications. Wound complications (20\% vs. 2\%, P less than or equal to 0.01), intensive-care-unit admissions (10\% vs. 2\%, P less than or equal to 0.01), reintubations (16\% vs. 2\%, P less than or equal to 0.03), and new-onset diabetes (12\% vs. 0\%, P less than or equal to 0.02) were all significantly more common in the obese group. These results suggest that an attempt at significant weight reduction is indicated in obese patients prior to renal transplantation.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Postoperative pancreatic fistula ({POPF}) is a most striking complication after pancreatic resection. The objective of this study is to reveal the risk factors for {POPF} defined by the international study group after pancreaticoduodenectomy in a Japanese high-volume center. {METHODS}: During the recent 4 years, 220 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomies. In patients of obstructive jaundice, preoperative biliary drainage was performed by percutaneous (n = 71) and/or retrograde (n = 38) approach. Pancreaticojejunostomy was performed using either duct-to-mucosa anastomosis (n = 180) or dunking method (n = 40). Risk factors for {POPF} (grade B or grade C {POPF} by international definition) were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. {RESULTS}: {POPF} was found in 109 (50\%) patients; grade A in 45 (21\%), grade B in 54 (25\%), and grade C in 10 patients (5\%). One patient died of intra-abdominal hemorrhage caused by {POPF}. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that independent risk factors for grade B or grade C {POPF} were the size of the main pancreatic duct ({\textless}3 mm; relative risk ({RR}), 3.3; p = 0.002), body mass index ({\textgreater} or =20, {RR} 2.5, p = 0.03), and bile juice infection on day 1 ({RR}, 2.2; p = 0.04). The performance of biliary drainage or method of pancreaticojejunostomy was not a significant risk factor for {POPF}. Bile juice infection on day 1 was significantly associated with retrograde biliary drainage (p {\textless} 0.001). {CONCLUSIONS}: Bile juice infection on day 1 was a significant risk factor for grade B or grade C {POPF} after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Although the performance or the status of biliary drainage itself was not a risk factor for {POPF}, percutaneous biliary drainage might be advantageous against retrograde drainage to reduce the risk of biliary infection.},

This study investigated whether, in patients with obstructive jaundice: (1) atrial natriuretic peptide ({ANP}) is increased; (2) fluid-regulating hormones are altered; and (3) biliary drainage improves fluid homoeostasis. {METHODS}: Forty-three patients with obstructive jaundice were investigated. A renal profile was obtained and levels of {ANP}, renin, aldosterone and vasopressin were determined. In a subset of 18 patients, studies were repeated 3 days after endoscopic biliary drainage and changes in extracellular volume were measured. {RESULTS}: Creatinine clearance was impaired in ten of 30 patients. Patients with obstructive jaundice had higher mean levels of {ANP} (118 versus 40 pg/ml, P = 0.0001) and aldosterone (156 versus 43 pg/ml, P = 0.0001) than matched controls. Increased renin levels were observed in ten of the 43 patients and were associated with impaired creatinine clearance. After biliary drainage {ANP} concentration decreased (110 versus 67 pg/ml, P = 0.004) as well as aldosterone level (182 versus 85 pg/ml, P = 0.0002) and the mean extracellular volume increased (20.5 versus 23.1 per cent of body-weight, P = 0.001). {CONCLUSION}: Plasma {ANP} concentration is increased in obstructive jaundice.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: In stage {II} colorectal cancer ({CRC}), high-risk patient selection is required, but no candidate markers have been elucidated. Our concern was whether anastomotic leakage (Lk) is a potential available clinicopathological factor for selecting high-risk stage {II}.
{METHODS}: Two hundred seven patients with stage {II} {CRC} who underwent curative resection were analyzed. Clinical variables were tested for their relationship to survival.
{RESULTS}: The 5-year disease-free survival rate ({DFS}) was 87.0\%. The univariable prognostic analyses indicated that Lk (P = 0.003) was the only significant factor. The multivariable prognostic analysis revealed that Lk remained to be potently independent [hazard ratio ({HR}), 4.21, P = 0.021), and the {DFS} was 58.3\% in cases with Lk, while 88.7\% in the counterpart. The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed perioperative blood transfusion (P = 0.001) was independently associated with Lk. Intriguingly, Lk was closely associated with hematogenic recurrence (P = 0.003) rather than peritoneal or local recurrence. Although sustained increase of the serum C-reactive protein at 2 weeks after operation predicted poor prognosis, the mutitivariable analysis including the C-reactive protein level revealed that Lk still indicated the prognostic potential ({HR}, 3.70, P = 0.075).
{CONCLUSIONS}: The findings concluded that Lk may be a high risk for systemic recurrence in stage {II} {CRC}.},

	abstract = {Liver transplantation has a significant early postoperative mortality rate. An accurate preoperative assessment is essential for minimizing mortality and optimizing limited donor organ resources. This study assessed the feasibility of preoperative submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) for determining the cardiopulmonary reserve in patients being assessed for liver transplantation and its potential for predicting 90-day posttransplant survival. One hundred eighty-two patients underwent {CPET} as part of their preoperative assessment for elective liver transplantation. The 90-day mortality rate, critical care length of stay, and hospital length of stay were determined during the prospective posttransplant follow-up. One hundred sixty-five of the 182 patients (91\%) successfully completed {CPET}; this was defined as the ability to determine a submaximal exercise parameter: the anaerobic threshold ({AT}). Sixty of the 182 patients (33\%) underwent liver transplantation, and the mortality rate was 10.0\% (6/60). The mean {AT} value was significantly higher for survivors versus nonsurvivors (12.0 ± 2.4 versus 8.4 ± 1.3 {mL}/minute/kg, P {\textless} 0.001). Logistic regression revealed that {AT}, donor age, blood transfusions, and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were significant univariate predictors of outcomes. In a multivariate analysis, only {AT} was retained as a significant predictor of mortality. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 90.7\% and 83.3\%, respectively, with good model accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.92, 95\% confidence interval = 0.82-0.97, P = 0.001). The optimal {AT} level for survival was defined to be {\textgreater}9.0 {mL}/minute/kg. The predictive value was improved when the ideal weight was substituted for the actual body weight of a patient with refractory ascites, even after a correction for the donor's age. In conclusion, the preoperative cardiorespiratory reserve (as defined by {CPET}) is a sensitive and specific predictor of early survival after liver transplantation. The predictive value of {CPET} requires further evaluation. Liver Transpl 18:152–159, 2012. © 2011 {AASLD}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Immune cell infiltrates are important determinants of colorectal cancer ({CRC}) outcome. Their presence may be driven by tumour or host-specific factors. From previous studies in mice, senescence, a state of cell cycle arrest, may moderate tumour progression through upregulation of antitumour immune responses. The relationships between senescence and immune infiltrates have not previously been studied in humans. We explore whether a marker of senescence (p16(ink4a)) in combination with low level expression of a proliferation marker (ki-67) relate to T cell infiltrates in {CRC}, and whether p16(ink4a), Ki-67 and immune infiltrates have similar prognostic value. {METHODS}: Immunostaining of p16(inka) and Ki-67 was performed within a {CRC} tissue microarray. Nuclear p16(inka) and Ki-67 were categorised as high/low. T-cell markers, {CD}3, {CD}45RO, {CD}8 and {FOXP}3 were scored separately as high/low grade in three areas of the tumour: the invasive margin ({IM}), tumour stroma and cancer cell nests ({CCNs}). results: Two hundred and thirty stage I-{III} cancers were studied. High nuclear p16(ink4a) was expressed in 63\% and high proliferation (Ki-67 {\textgreater}15\%) in 61\%. p16(ink4a) expression was associated with reduced {CD}45RO+ cells at the {IM} (P{\textless}0.05) and within the stroma (P{\textless}0.05) and reduced {CD}8+ cells at the {IM} (P{\textless}0.01). A low Ki-67 proliferative index was associated with reduced density of  {CD}3+ cells in {CCNs} (P{\textless}0.01), reduced {CD}45RO+ cells at the {IM} (P{\textless}0.05) and within  the {CCNs} (P{\textless}0.001), reduced {FOXP}3+ cells at the {IM} (P{\textless}0.001), within the stroma (P=0.001) and within {CCNs} (P{\textless}0.001) and reduced {CD}8+ cells at the {IM} (P{\textless}0.05) and within the {CCNs} (P{\textless}0.05). Tumours with both a low proliferative index and expression of p16(ink4a) demonstrated similar consistent relationships with reduced densities of T-cell infiltrates. On multivariate analysis, {TNM} stage (P{\textless}0.001), low {CD}3 cells at the {IM} (P=0.014), low {CD}8 cells at the {IM} (P=0.037),  low proliferation (Ki-67; P=0.013) and low senescence (p16(ink4a); P=0.002) were  independently associated with poorer cancer survival. {CONCLUSION}: Senescence, proliferation and immune cell infiltrates are independent prognostic factors in {CRC}. Although related to survival, p16(ink4a)-associated senescence is not associated with an upregulation of antitumour T-cell responses.},

	abstract = {Peak O2 uptake ({VO}2) has traditionally been compared among individuals differing in body composition by dividing measured values (l/min) by fat-free mass ({FFM}) (i.e., ratio method). However, the ability of the ratio method to mathematically remove the confounding influence of {FFM} from peak {VO}2 has recently been questioned. Therefore, we compared the effectiveness of the ratio method vs. regression modeling to normalize peak {VO}2 in a large cohort of males and females for differences in {FFM}. Regression modeling adjusts peak {VO}2 according to the relationship derived from the regression of peak {VO}2 on {FFM}. Results showed that peak {VO}2 was 60\% higher in males (3.53 +/- 1.0 l/min) than in females (2.22 +/- 0.6 l/min; P {\textless} 0.01). With the ratio method (i.e., peak {VO}2/{FFM}), peak {VO}2 was 15\% higher in males (54.6 +/- 12 ml . kg {FFM} 1 . min-1) than in females (47.4 +/- 11 ml . kg {FFM}-1 . min-1; P {\textless} 0.01). In contrast, when a regression-based approach was employed to normalize values, no significant difference in adjusted peak {VO}2 was observed between males and females (3.04 +/- 0.9 vs. 3.01 +/- 1.0 l/min). In conclusion, dividing peak {VO}2 by {FFM} can produce spurious results, because this approach does not take into account the nonzero intercept. Therefore, a regression-based approach should be used to normalize peak {VO}2.},

	url = {http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16128952},
	abstract = {{AIM}: To compare the efficacy of metal versus plastic stents for biliary strictures in patients with surgically resectable pancreatic cancer. {METHODS}: The medical records at {MD} Anderson Caner Center from September 2001 to May 2004 were reviewed. Fifty-five patients were identified to have either a metal biliary stent (13 patients, group A) or a plastic biliary stent (42 patients, group B) and subsequently went to surgery. These two groups were compared with regards to number of stents placed prior to surgery, time period between the last stent and surgery, and operative and postoperative complications. {RESULTS}: Of the 13 patients in group A, 12 had pancreaticoduodenectomy performed and one had exploration only due to the peritoneal metastatses discovered at the time of surgery. Of the 12 patients with pancreaticoduodenectomy, 10 had pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 1 intraductal papillary mucinous tumor, and 1 ampullary cancer. Only 2 patients required an additional endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ({ERCP}) after initial metal stent placement until surgery. The average time between last stent placement and surgery was 106.5 days. Of the 42 patients in group B, 35 had pancreaticoduodenectomy and 7 had either palliative surgery or exploration due to metastatic diseases discovered at the time of surgery. Of the 35 patients, 27 had pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 5 ampullary cancer, 1 neuroendocrine tumor, 1 microcystic adenoma, and 1 autoimmune pancreatitis. Sixteen patients (38\%) in group B required 3 or more {ERCPs} with plastic stents prior to surgery. The average time between last stent placement and surgery was 56.4 days. Preoperative chemoradiation was given to all 13 patients in group A and 31 of 42 patients in group B. There were no stent-related intra- or postoperative complications in both groups. Two of 13 patients (15\%) with metal stents versus 39 of 42 patients (93\%) with plastic stents, however, developed either cholangitis or cholestasis due to stent occlusion while waiting for surgery. {CONCLUSIONS}: Contrary to the belief that metal stents are contraindicated for patients with surgically resectable pancreatic cancer, our study demonstrated that metal stents provided a longer patency rate, fewer {ERCP} sessions, and fewer episodes of cholangitis without adding any intra- or postoperative complications. Therefore, metal stents should be considered for patients with resectable pancreatic cancer, especially if surgery is not immediately planned as more patients are now receiving preoperative chemoradiation.},

	url = {http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10769088},
	abstract = {It has been suggested that the placement of endoscopic or percutaneous biliary stents prior to pancreaticoduodenectomy increases postoperative morbidity. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed. Patients undergoing preoperative biliary stenting were compared with patients who did not undergo stenting. In addition, outcomes after endoscopic and percutaneous stenting were compared. Patients who had undergone operative biliary bypass prior to pancreaticoduodenectomy were excluded from the analysis. Between January 1994 and December 1997, 567 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy without prior operative biliary bypass. Preoperative biliary stenting was performed in 408 patients (72\%), whereas the remaining 159 patients (28\%) did not undergo biliary stenting. In the stented group, 64\% had stents placed via a percutaneous approach and 36\% had stents placed endoscopically. The stented patients were older (mean 63.1 years vs. 61.4 years; P = 0.05) and were more likely to be white (92\% vs. 82\%; P = 0.005). Those who had stents placed were more likely to have jaundice (67\% vs. 38\%; P {\textless}0.0001) and fever (5\% vs. 1\%; P = 0.03) as presenting symptoms. There were no differences in multiple intraoperative parameters when the two groups were compared. Patients who had stents placed had a perioperative mortality rate of 1.7\% compared to 2.5\% in those who did not (P = 0.3). Although the overall complication rates were 35\% in those who had stents placed and 30\% in those who did not (P = {NS}), patients with stents experienced a significantly increased incidence of pancreatic fistula (10\% vs. 4\%; P = 0.02) and wound infection (10\% vs. 4\%; P = 0.02). The incidences of other postoperative complications were similar between the stented and unstented groups. Eight patients (3\%) in the percutaneously stented group developed significant hemobilia after stent placement, whereas none of the patients undergoing endoscopic stent placement developed hemobilia (P = 0.03). There were no statistical differences in other complications between the percutaneously and endoscopically stented groups. Preoperative biliary stenting did not increase the overall complication rate or mortality rate in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Stenting does appear to increase the rate of pancreatic fistula formation, possibly as a result of pancreatic inflammation related to the stenting procedure. Stenting also increases the rate of wound infection, likely secondary to contaminated bile (bactibilia) after instrumentation of the biliary tree. Preoperative biliary stenting is safe but should be used selectively because of the above-mentioned risks. The method of stenting should be based on local expertise.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The nonparenchymal cells ({NPC}) of the liver have strong cytotoxic activity. Our hypothesis is that their activity may be imparted by obstructive jaundice and show recovery after biliary drainage. {METHODS}: In Donryu rats, we performed either a sham operation (group C; n = 5), production of irreversible obstructive jaundice (group J; n = 5), or production of reversible obstructive jaundice for 7 days, with biliary drainage then provided for 3 days (group Ds; n = 5) or for 14 days (group Dl; n = 5). Natural killer ({NK})-cell activities shown against {YAC}-1 lymphoma cells of hepatic {NPC} and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were assessed. We then measured the growth of experimental liver metastases 13 days after inoculation of a tumor cell line ({AH}130) into the portal vein of rats that had undergone similar biliary manipulations (group {mC}, group {mJ}, group {mDs}, and group {mDl}; n = 5 in each group). {RESULTS}: The highest number of {NK} activities by {NPC} in group J (11.5\%) and group Ds (37.7\%) were significantly lower than those in group C (68.8\%) and group Dl (90.5\%; effector/target ratios, 40:1; P {\textless} .01). {NK} activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was similar among groups. Metastatic liver tumors in group {mJ} (10.2\% +/- 2.6\%) and group {mDs} (5.4\% +/- 1.5\%) were significantly larger than in group {mC} (0.4\% +/- 0.1\%) and group {mDl} (0.5\% +/- 0.3\%; P {\textless} .02). {CONCLUSIONS}: Obstructive jaundice depressed the {NK} activity of hepatic {NPC} and enhanced the growth of liver metastases. To counter this depression, adequate biliary drainage was required. These results suggest that preoperative biliary drainage to relieve obstructive jaundice might help to prevent liver metastases after surgery for biliary tract or pancreatic tumors.},

Statistical analysis was performed by the Mann-Whitney test, with the level of significance set at 5\% (p{\textless}0.05). {RESULTS}: Statistical analysis revealed a significant drop in oxygen consumption during stage 3 mitochondrial respiration in group {IC} compared with {SO}, whereas the values obtained during stage 4 were basically identical for the two groups.

However, this method systematically underestimates cardiopulmonary fitness in obese individuals. Our aim was to analyse whether lean-mass is a better base for a body mass-independent standard of cardiopulmonary fitness.
Methods A population based sample of 578 men (body mass index ({BMI}) 19–47 kg/m2) and 592 women ({BMI} 16–49 kg/m2) 57–78 years of age. Peak {VO}2 was assessed by respiratory gas analysis during a maximal exercise test on a cycle ergometer. We studied the validity of the weight-ratio and the lean mass-ratio standards in a linear regression model.
Results The weight-ratio standard implies an increase of peak {VO}2 per additional kg body weight with 20.7 ml/min (95\% confidence interval ({CI}): 20.3–21.1) in women and 26.9 ml/min (95\% {CI}: 26.4–27.5) in men. The observed increase per kg is only 8.5 ml/min (95\% {CI}: 6.5–10.5) in men and 10.4 ml/min (95\% {CI}: 7.5–13.4) in women. For the lean mass-ratio standard expected and observed increases in peak {VO}2 per kg lean mass were 32.3 (95\% {CI}: 31.8–32.9) and 34.6 (95\% {CI}: 30.0–39.1) ml/min for women and 36.2 (95\% {CI}: 35.6–36.8) and 37.3 (95\% {CI}: 32.1–42.4) ml/min in men. The lean mass-ratio standard is a body mass-independent measure of cardiopulmonary fitness in 100\% of women and 58\% of men; corresponding values for the weight-ratio standard were 11\% and 16\%.
Conclusions For comparisons of cardiopulmonary fitness across different categories of body mass, the lean mass-ratio standard should be used.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The Glasgow Prognostic Score ({GPS}), an inflammation-based prognostic  score formed from standard thresholds of C reactive protein ({CRP}) and albumin, has prognostic value in patients with advanced cancer. Little is known about the  general biochemical disturbance associated with the systemic inflammatory response in cancer. {AIM}: To examine the relationship between the {GPS} and blood biochemistry in patients with advanced lung and gastrointestinal cancer. {METHODS}: The {GPS} (albumin {\textless}35 g/l = 1 and {CRP} {\textgreater}10 mg/l = 1 combined to form a prognostic score of 0 (normal) and 1 or 2 (abnormal)) and a variety of biochemical variables were examined in patients (n = 50) with advanced lung or gastrointestinal cancer  and in a healthy control group (n = 13). {RESULTS}: The {GPS} was normal in all the controls, but abnormal in 78\% of the cancer group. Serum levels of sodium, chloride, creatine kinase, zinc and vitamin D were lower in the cancer group (all p{\textless}0.01), whereas levels of calcium, copper (both p{\textless}0.05), alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (both p{\textless}0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase (p{\textless}0.10) were raised. In the patient group, with increasing {GPS}, there was a median reduction in Karnofsky Performance Status (25\%), haemoglobin (22\%), sodium (3\%), zinc (15\%) and survival (93\%, all p{\textless}0.05) and a median increase in white cell count (129\%),  alkaline phosphatase (217\%), gamma-glutamyl transferase (371\%) and lactate dehydrogenase (130\%, all p{\textless}0.05). {CRP} levels were strongly and similarly correlated with alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, accounting for more than 25\% of the variation in their activities. {CONCLUSION}: Several correlations were seen between biochemical variables and increasing {GPS}. In particular, chronic activation of the systemic inflammatory response in cancer was associated with increase in gamma-glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase activity in patients with advanced lung and gastrointestinal cancer.},

	url = {http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114014},
	abstract = {Pancreatic duct stenting remains an attractive strategy to reduce the incidence of pancreatic fistulas following pancreaticoduodenectomy ({PD}) with encouraging results in both retrospective and prospective studies. We performed a prospective randomized trial to test the hypothesis that internal pancreatic duct stenting reduces the development of pancreatic fistulas following {PD}. Two hundred thirty-eight patients were randomized to either receive a pancreatic stent (S) or no stent ({NS}), and stratified according to the texture of the pancreatic remnant (soft/normal versus hard). Four patients were excluded from the study; in three instances due to a pancreatic duct that was too small to cannulate and in the other instance because a total pancreatectomy was performed. Patients who randomized to the S group had a 6-cm-long segment of a plastic pediatric feeding tube used to stent the pancreaticojejunostomy anastomosis. In patients with a soft pancreas, 57 randomized to the S group and 56 randomized to the {NS} group. In patients with a hard pancreas, 58 randomized to the S group and 63 randomized to the {NS} group. The S and {NS} groups for the entire study population, as well as for the subgroup of high-risk patients with soft pancreata, were similar as regard to demographics, past medical history, preoperative symptoms, preoperative procedures, and intraoperative data. The pancreatic fistula rate for the entire study population was 9.4\%. The fistula rates in the S and {NS} subgroups with hard pancreata were similar, at 1.7\% and 4.8\% (P = 0.4), respectively. The fistula rates in the S and {NS} subgroups with soft pancreata were also similar, at 21.1\% and 10.7\% (P = 0.1), respectively. A nonstatistically significant increase in the pancreatic fistula rate in the S group persisted after adjusting for the operating surgeon and technical details of the operation (e.g., anastomotic technique, anastomotic orientation, pancreatic duct size, and number of intra-abdominal drains placed). In patients with soft pancreata, 63\% percent of the pancreatic fistulas in stented patients required adjustment to the clinical pathway (including two deaths), compared to 47\% of the pancreatic fistulas in patients in the {NS} group (P = 0.3). Internal pancreatic duct stenting does not decrease the frequency or the severity of postoperative pancreatic fistulas.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine differences in cancer survival between socioeconomic groups in England, with particular attention to survival in the short term of follow-up. Patients and methods: Individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1996 and 2004 in England were identified from cancer registry records. Five-year cumulative relative survival and excess death rates were computed. Results: For colon cancer there was a very high excess death rate in the first month of follow-up, and the excess death rate was highest in the socioeconomically deprived groups. In subsequent periods, excess mortality rates were much lower and there was less socioeconomic variation. The pattern of variation in excess death rates was generally similar in rectal cancer but the socioeconomic difference in death rates persisted several years longer. If the excess death rates in the entire colorectal cancer patient population were the same as those observed in the most affluent socioeconomic quintile, the annual reduction would be 360 deaths in colon cancer and 336 deaths in rectal cancer patients. These deaths occurred almost entirely in the first month and the first year after diagnosis. Conclusion: Recent developments in the national cancer control agenda have included an increasing emphasis on outcome measures, with short-term cancer survival an operational measure of variation and progress in cancer control. In providing clues to the nature of the survival differences between socioeconomic groups, the results presented here give strong support for this strategy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Reorganization of colorectal cancer services has led to surgery being increasingly, but not exclusively, delivered by specialist surgeons. Outcomes from colorectal cancer surgery have improved, but the exact determinants remain unclear. This study explored the determinants of outcome after colorectal cancer  surgery over time. {METHODS}: Postoperative mortality (within 30 days of surgery) and 5-year relative survival rates for patients in the West of Scotland undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer between 1991 and 1994 were compared with rates for those having surgery between 2001 and 2004. {RESULTS}: The 1823 patients  who had surgery in 2001-2004 were more likely to have had stage I or {III} tumours, and to have undergone surgery with curative intent than the 1715 patients operated on in 1991-1994. The proportion of patients presenting electively who received surgery by a specialist surgeon increased over time (from 14.9 to 72.8 per cent; P {\textless} 0.001). Postoperative mortality increased among patients treated by non-specialists over time (from 7.4 to 10.3 per cent; P = 0.026). Non-specialist  surgery was associated with an increased risk of postoperative death (adjusted odds ratio 1.72, 95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 1.17 to 2.55; P = 0.006)  compared with specialist surgery. The 5-year relative survival rate increased over time and was higher among those treated by specialist compared with non-specialist surgeons (62.1 versus 53.0 per cent; P {\textless} 0.001). Compared with the earlier period, the adjusted relative excess risk ratio for the later period was  0.69 (95 per cent c.i. 0.61 to 0.79; P {\textless} 0.001). Increased surgical specialization accounted for 18.9 per cent of the observed survival improvement.  {CONCLUSION}: Increased surgical specialization contributed significantly to the observed improvement in longer-term survival following colorectal cancer surgery.},

	volume = {150},
	url = {http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21878237},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Abdominal surgery represents a physiologic stress and is associated with a period of recovery during which functional capacity is often diminished. "Prehabilitation" is a program to increase functional capacity in anticipation of an upcoming stressor. We reported recently the results of a randomized trial comparing 2 prehabilitation programs before colorectal surgery (stationary cycling plus weight training versus a recommendation to increase walking coupled with breathing exercises); however, adherence to the programs was low. The objectives of this study were to estimate: (1) the extent to which physical function could be improved with either prehabilitation program and identify variables associated with response; and (2) the impact of change in preoperative function on postoperative recovery. {METHODS}: This study involved a reanalysis of data arising from a randomized trial. The primary outcome measure was functional walking capacity measured by the Six-Minute Walk Test; secondary outcomes were anxiety, depression, health-related quality of life, and complications (Clavien classification). Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the extent to which key variables predicted change in functional walking capacity over the prehabilitation and follow-up periods. {RESULTS}: We included 95 people who completed the prehabilitation phase (median, 38 days; interquartile range, 22-60), and 75 who were also evaluated postoperatively (mean, 9 weeks). During prehabilitation, 33\% improved their physical function, 38\% stayed within 20 m of their baseline score, and 29\% deteriorated. Among those who improved, mental health, vitality, self-perceived health, and peak exercise capacity also increased significantly. Women were less likely to improve; low baseline walking capacity, anxiety, and the belief that fitness aids recovery were associated with improvements during prehabilitation. In the postoperative phase, the patients who had improved during prehabilitation were also more likely to have recovered to their baseline walking capacity than those with no change or deterioration (77\% vs 59\% and 32\%; P = .0007). Patients who deteriorated were at greater risk of complications requiring reoperation and/or intensive care management. Significant predictors of poorer recovery included deterioration during prehabilitation, age {\textgreater}75 years, high anxiety, complications requiring intervention, and timing of follow-up assessment. {CONCLUSION}: In a group of patients undergoing scheduled colorectal surgery, meaningful changes in functional capacity can be achieved over several weeks of prehabilitation. Patients and those who care for them, especially those with poor physical capacity, should consider a prehabilitation regimen to enhance functional exercise capacity before colectomy.},

	abstract = {Background: Obesity, defined by body mass index ({BMI}), appears to have a paradoxical protective effect in several chronic diseases.
Objective: We investigated the obesity paradox in cancer patients by using body composition.
Design: The study was an observational study of 175 cancer patients assessed before chemotherapy. Obesity was defined as {BMI} (in kg/m2) ≥30 or fat mass index ({FMI}; fat mass divided by the square of height) ≥5.2 (men) and ≥8.2 (women) measured by using a bioelectrical impedance analysis. Low muscle mass (sarcopenia) was defined as fat-free mass index (fat-free mass divided by the square of height) {\textless}17.5 (men) and {\textless}15.1 (women).
Results: Most patients were women (65.7\%) and had a mean (±{SD}) age of 56.9 ± 12.8 y. According to {BMI} criteria, 60\% of patients were overweight or obese. The median survival time for overweight (2.64 y; range: 0.23–3.16 y) and obese (2.61 y; range: 0.26–3.20 y) patients was significantly higher than for patients with a normal (2.04 y; range: 0.06–3.05 y) or low (0.52 y; range: 0.19–0.98 y) {BMI} (P {\textless} 0.001). Sarcopenic patients had shorter survival, regardless of their {FMI}. Obesity predicted higher survival rates only when sarcopenia was absent. In a multivariate Cox regression model, sarcopenia was an independent predictor of higher mortality ({HR}: 5.19; 95\% {CI}: 2.58, 10.43) after we controlled for {BMI}, age, and tumor stage.
Conclusions: The obesity paradox is present in cancer patients only when obesity is defined by {BMI}. Patients with sarcopenic obesity had the poorest prognosis. Cancer patients with high mortality risk can be identified by a body-composition assessment.},

	abstract = {Data exist on the morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy ({PD}), but there are few reports about hospital readmissions after this procedure. Our aim was to evaluate the number of and reasons for readmission after {PD} and the factors influencing readmission. We reviewed the initial hospitalization and readmissions for 1643 patients undergoing {PD} compared patients requiring readmission to patients that did not require readmission. Twenty-six percent of patients were readmitted a total of 678 times after {PD}. Patients readmitted were younger than those not readmitted (61.8 versus 64.6 years, P {\textless} 0.0001). Vessel resection, abscess formation, wound infection, postoperative percutaneous biliary stents, estimated blood loss {\textgreater}1000 ml, and age {\textless} or =65 years were independently associated with readmission. The length of stay for all patients decreased over time, from 10.5 days in 1996 to 7 days in 2003. The percentage of patients being readmitted also decreased from 33\% in 1996 to 20\% (P = 0.004) in 2003. The readmission rate after {PD} was 26\%. Younger age, blood loss, postoperative complications, and vessel resection were independent risk factors for readmission. The early hospital readmission rate has not increased in association with a decreased {LOS}, supporting the idea that reduction in {LOS} did not lead to increased readmission rates.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To examine the clinical utility of improved detection of venous invasion ({VI}) in patients undergoing potentially curative resection of colorectal cancer. {BACKGROUND}: {VI} is a feature of colorectal cancer ({CRC}) progression. Elastica staining can be used to improve detection of {VI} and correspondingly its  prediction of patient survival. {METHODS}: A single-center, observational study of  pathology variables, including detection of {VI} by staining for elastica, using 631 stage I to {III} {CRC} specimens, collected from 1997 to 2009 (176 analyzed retrospectively and 455 analyzed prospectively), was performed. {RESULTS}: {VI} was detected in 56\% of patients with {CRC}. Over a median follow-up period of 73 months, 238 patients died (134 from cancer). On multivariate analysis, {VI} by elastica staining was associated with a shorter survival duration, independent of other pathology features, in all cases [hazard ratio ({HR}) = 3.94, 95\% confidence  interval ({CI}): 2.33-6.65, P {\textless} 0.001] and in node-negative cases ({HR} = 3.55, 95\% {CI}: 1.81-6.97; P {\textless} 0.001). In the absence of elastica-detected {VI}, with the exception of T stage, no other pathology features were associated with survival time. Therefore, the combination of T stage and {VI} ({TVI}) on survival was examined. Five-year cancer mortality could be stratified between 100\% and 54\% for patients with node-negative tumors and between 100\% and 33\% for patients with node-positive tumors. In all cases, the {TVI} had similar predictive value as that  of T stage and node status ({TNM}). In node-negative disease, {TVI} had superior predictive value. {CONCLUSIONS}: The results of the present study have prompted the development of a novel tumor staging system based on {TVI}. The {TVI} has clinical utility, especially in node-negative disease, in predicting outcome following curative resection for {CRC}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Body mass index ({BMI}) has proven unreliable in predicting survival following pancreaticoduodenectomy for cancer. While measures of intra-abdominal fat correlate with medical and postoperative complications of obesity, the impact of intra-abdominal fat on pancreatic cancer survival is uncertain. We hypothesized that the quantity of intra-abdominal fat would predict survival following resection of pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS}: Preoperative {CT} imaging was used to measure intra-abdominal fat. Cox regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of survival.
{RESULTS}: Sixty-one patients from 2000-2009 underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinoma. After adjusting for age and perineural invasion status, preoperative {BMI} did not predict overall survival (p {\textless} 0.827). Unlike {BMI}, quartile of intra-abdominal fat predicted survival. Relative to patients with the least intra-abdominal fat (lowest quartile), those with more intra-abdominal fat demonstrated worse overall survival, but in a non-linear fashion. Individuals in the second quartile showed a fourfold increase in likelihood of death ({HR} 4.018, 95\% {CI} 1.099-14.687, p {\textless} 0.035) relative to the lowest quartile. Patients in the third ({HR} 2.124, 95\% {CI} 0.278-16.222, p {\textless} 0.468) and fourth quartile ({HR} 1.354, 95\% {CI} 0.296-6.190, p {\textless} 0.696) also showed greater risk of death.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Measuring intra-abdominal fat identifies a subset of patients with worse prognosis in pancreatic cancer.},

A positive correlation between tumour stage and plasma {CRP} levels was  demonstrated in prostate cancer, indicating a relationship between raised {CRP} levels and more aggressive disease, suggesting a role for inflammatory response in tumour progression. Aim of this study was to assess the tumoural presence and  cellular location of {CRP} and establish if these are linked to clinicopathological features of the cohort and patient survival. Tissue microarray technology was employed to analyse 50 matched pairs of hormone sensitive and refractory prostate cancers. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibody to {CRP}. {CRP} was assessed using the weighted histoscore method. {CRP} presence was observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of selected tumours. Cytoplasmic {CRP} correlated positively  with metastases at diagnosis (P=0.039), whereas nuclear {CRP} presence correlated with metastases at relapse (P=0.006). A trend towards an increase in cytoplasmic  and nuclear {CRP} presence from hormone sensitive to hormone refractory tumours was noticed. No significant association between tumoural {CRP} presence, time to biochemical relapse or disease-specific survival was observed. Tumoural {CRP} is likely to have a role in progression of prostate cancer, as it is associated with increased presence of metastases at the time of diagnosis and time of relapse.

We hypothesized that aerobic fitness—assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET})—would be associated with circulating inflammatory markers, as quantified by the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}) and monocyte subsets. The association between cardiopulmonary reserve and inflammation was tested by multivariable regression analysis with covariates including anaerobic threshold ({AT}) and malignancy. In a first cohort of 240 colorectal patients, {AT} was identified as the sole factor associated with higher {NLR} (P = 0.03) and absolute and relative lymphopenia (P = 0.01). Preoperative leukocyte subsets and monocyte {CD}14+ expression (downregulated by endotoxin and indicative of chronic inflammation) were also assessed in two further cohorts of age-matched elective gastrointestinal and orthopaedic surgical patients. Monocyte {CD}14+ expression was lower in gastrointestinal patients (n = 43) compared to age-matched orthopaedic patients (n = 31). The circulating {CD}14+{CD}16− monocyte subset was reduced in patients with low cardiopulmonary reserve. Poor exercise capacity in patients without a diagnosis of heart failure is independently associated with markers of inflammation. These observations suggest that preoperative inflammation associated with impaired cardiorespiratory performance may contribute to the pathophysiology of postoperative outcome.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Postoperative hemorrhage is one of the most severe complications after pancreatic surgery. Due to the lack of an internationally accepted, universal definition of postpancreatectomy hemorrhage ({PPH}), the incidences reported in the literature vary considerably, even in reports from randomized controlled trials. Because of these variations in the definition of what constitutes a {PPH}, the incidences of its occurrence are not comparable. {METHODS}: The International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery ({ISGPS}) developed an objective, generally applicable definition of {PPH} based on a literature review and consensus clinical experience. {RESULTS}: Postpancreatectomy hemorrhage is defined by 3 parameters: onset, location, and severity. The onset is either early ({\textless} or =24 hours after the end of the index operation) or late ({\textgreater}24 hours). The location is either intraluminal or extraluminal. The severity of bleeding may be either mild or severe. Three different grades of {PPH} (grades A, B, and C) are defined according to the time of onset, site of bleeding, severity, and clinical impact. {CONCLUSIONS}: An objective, universally accepted definition and clinical grading of {PPH} is important for the appropriate management and use of interventions in {PPH}. Such a definition also would allow comparisons of results from future clinical trials. Such standardized definitions are necessary to compare, in a nonpartisan manner, the outcomes of studies and the evaluation of novel operative treatment modalities in pancreatic surgery.},

Methods Clinical data were reviewed from 200 consecutive patients who had periampullary cancer and underwent {PD} between October 2003 and July 2010, and survival outcomes and recurrence patterns were analyzed. Postoperative complications were classified according to a modification of Clavien’s classification. Results Overall, 86 major complications of grade {II} or higher occurred in 71 patients. The patients were classified into two groups according to the presence of postoperative complications of grade {II} or higher: group Cx−, absence of complications (n = 129); and group Cx+, presence of complications (n = 71). There were no differences in gender, mean age, tumor node metastasis stage, biliary drainage, type of resection, and radicality between the two groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The 3-year overall and disease-free survival rates of the group Cx+ patients (31.0 and 22.3 \%, respectively) were significantly lower than those of the group Cx− patients (49.0 and 40.0 \%; P = 0.003 and 0.002, respectively). The multivariate analysis showed that postoperative complications (P = 0.001; {RR} = 1.887; 95 \% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.278–2.785), a T stage of T3 or T4 (P = 0.001; {RR} = 2.503; 95 \% {CI} 1.441–4.346), positive node metastasis (P = 0.001; {RR} = 2.093; 95 \% {CI}, 1.378–3.179), R1 or R2 resection (P = 0.023; {RR} = 1.863; 95 \% {CI} 1.090–3.187), and angiolymphatic invasion (P = 0.013; {RR} = 1.676; 95 \% {CI} 1.117–2.513) were independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The tumor-associated inflammatory cell infiltrate is recognized to have prognostic value in various common solid tumors. However, the prognostic value of the tumor inflammatory cell infiltrate has not been established in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDAC}) nor has its relationship with the systemic inflammatory response.
{METHODS}: Retrospective study was made of 173 patients who underwent surgery between 1997 and 2009. Routine pathology specimens were scored according to density of the tumor inflammatory cell infiltrate, and biochemical data were collected preoperatively.
{RESULTS}: Low-grade tumor inflammatory cell infiltrate was associated with earlier tumor recurrence (P {\textless} 0.001) and particularly in the liver (P = 0.027). It was also associated with T3 tumors (P {\textless} 0.05), lymph node involvement (P {\textless} 0.05), and resection margin involvement (P {\textless} 0.05).

{METHODS}: Patients undergoing pancreatic surgery for neoplasms were identified from the {NSQIP} database (2006-2008). Indices associated with increased resource utilization that we included were operative time ({OT}), length of stay ({LOS}), intraoperative {RBC} transfusion, return to operating room, and occurrence of postoperative complications. Analysis of covariance and multivariable logistic regression were performed.
{RESULTS}: The 4,306 included patients had a median age of 66 years and 50.3\% were males. The 30-day morbidity and mortality were 29.3\% and 3.2\%, respectively.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To demonstrate our strategy for hilar bile duct cancer and to elucidate prognostic factors and the surgeon's role in long-term survival. {SUMMARY} {BACKGROUND} {DATA}: Extended hemihepatectomy is recognized as a curative treatment of hilar bile duct cancer but is not always safe because of the risk of postoperative liver failure. A safe and beneficial strategy is required. {METHODS}: Fifty-eight consecutive major hepatectomies for hilar bile duct cancer were reviewed retrospectively. Appropriate preoperative treatments, biliary drainage, and portal embolization were performed before major hepatectomies. The short- and long-term results of our strategy are presented and analyzed. {RESULTS}: Biliary drainage and portal embolization were performed in 39 patients (67.2\%) and 31 patients (53.4\%), respectively. Major hepatectomies comprised 27 extended right and 22 extended left hemihepatectomies and 9 hepatoduodenopancreatectomies. Operative morbidity and mortality rates were 43\% and 0\%, respectively. There was no postoperative liver failure. The overall 5-year survival rate was 40\%. Univariate analysis showed that residual tumor status, lymph node involvement, and perineural invasion were associated with patients' long-term survival. A surgical margin over 5 mm resulted in better long-term survival. The delay resulting from preoperative treatment was not detrimental to long-term survival. Multivariate analysis showed that lymph node involvement was the only prognostic factor. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our strategy, which includes preoperative biliary drainage and portal embolization, led to a reduction in the risks associated with major hepatectomy for hilar bile duct cancer, and resulted in zero mortality. Surgeons should aim at complete clearance of the tumor with an adequate surgical margin to ensure optimal long-term survival.},

	abstract = {Background:
The impact of anastomotic leakage on immediate postoperative mortality in patients undergoing potentially curative resection for colorectal cancer is well recognized. Its impact on long-term survival is less clear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between anastomotic leakage and long-term survival in patients undergoing potentially curative resection for colorectal cancer.
Methods:
A total of 2235 patients who underwent potentially curative resection for colorectal cancer between 1991 and 1994 in Scotland were included in the study. Five-year survival rates and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated.
Results:
Fourteen (16 per cent) of the 86 patients with an anastomotic leak died within 30 days of surgery compared with 83 (3·9 per cent) of 2149 without a leak. The 5-year cancer-specific survival rate, including postoperative deaths, was 42 per cent in patients with an anastomotic leak compared with 66·9 per cent in those with no leak (P {\textless} 0·001). Excluding postoperative deaths, respective values were 50 and 68·0 per cent (P {\textless} 0·001). The adjusted relative hazard ratios, for patients with an anastomotic leak compared with those without a leak, and excluding 30-day mortality, were 1·61 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 1·19 to 2·16; P = 0·002) for overall survival and 1·99 (95 per cent c.i. 1·42 to 2·79; P {\textless} 0·001) for cancer-specific survival.
Conclusion:
Development of an anastomotic leak is associated with worse long-term survival after potentially curative resection for colorectal cancer. Copyright © 2005 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Published by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	url = {http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15004771},
	abstract = {The shortage of donor organs highlights the need to better identify patients most likely to benefit from hepatic transplantation. Reduced aerobic capacity (decreased peak oxygen consumption [{VO}(2)] during symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing) is frequently present in cirrhosis. Peak {VO}(2) during cardiopulmonary exercise testing may predict short-term outcome after hepatic transplantation. Symptom-limited testing was performed on a cycle ergometer (continuous ramp protocol) and {VO}(2) determined using a metabolic cart. One hundred fifty-six patients were tested; 59 subsequently underwent hepatic transplantation. Results showed that survivors and nonsurvivors were similar in age, duration of liver disease, Child-Pugh score, {MELD} score, resting cardiovascular function, pulmonary function, and gas exchange. The 6 (10.2\%) patients dying within 100 days of transplantation were more likely to have reduced aerobic capacity (peak {VO}(2) {\textless}60\% predicted and {VO}(2) at anaerobic threshold [{VO}(2)-{AT}] {\textless}50\% predicted peak {VO}(2)) compared to survivors (4/6 vs. 7/53, P {\textless}.01). Using a multiple logistic regression model controlling for duration and severity of liver disease and time to transplantation, reduced aerobic capacity was independently associated with 100-day mortality. In conclusion, reduced aerobic capacity during cardiopulmonary exercise testing is associated with decreased short-term survival after hepatic transplantation. Further study is needed to determine if cardiopulmonary exercise testing can be used to improve allocation of donor organs. To ensure optimum allocation of donor organs, it is important to identify patients most likely to benefit from transplantation. Investigators have identified a number of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors that predict increased risk for postoperative mortality. Unfortunately, predictive accuracy has not been high, and the timing of factor identification does not optimize organ utilization. Identification of predictors of survival at the time of listing for transplantation might lead to better resource allocation.},

Of the 67 patients without {PBD}, serum bilirubin was {\textgreater}10 mg\% in 41 patients (group B) while 26 patients had bilirubin level of {\textless}10 mg\% (group C). {RESULT}: Patients were well matched for age, sex distribution, presence of medical risk factors, duration of surgery, operative blood loss and stage of disease. Group A patients had a higher incidence of wound infection (43 vs. 24\%; p = 0.03), intra-abdominal abscess (28 vs. 15\%; p = 0.06), pancreaticojejunal anastomotic leak (20 vs. 5\%; p = 0.01) and overall infective complications (52 vs. 29\%; p = 0.01) compared to group B patients, and a higher overall infective complication rate than group C patients (52 vs. 27\%; p = 0.02). Group B patients had a higher incidence of intra-abdominal bleeding compared to group A (20 vs. 6\%; p = 0.01) and group C patients (20 vs. 4\%; p = 0.03).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS}: Endoscopic placement of plastic or self-expandable metal biliary stents ({SEMS}) relieves obstructive jaundice from pancreatic cancer. Short-length, distally placed {SEMS} do not preclude subsequent pancreaticoduodenectomy. We sought to determine whether {SEMS} placement in patients whose surgical status is uncertain is cost-effective for management of obstructive jaundice. {METHODS}: A Markov model was constructed to evaluate costs and outcomes associated with endoscopic biliary stenting for obstructive jaundice. Strategies evaluated were: (1) initial plastic stent with plastic stents for subsequent occlusions in nonsurgical candidates after staging (plastic followed-up by [f/u] plastic), (2) initial plastic with subsequent {SEMS} (plastic f/u metal), (3) initial short-length {SEMS} with subsequent plastic (metal f/u plastic), and (4) initial short-length {SEMS} with subsequent expandable metal stent (metal f/u metal). Published stent occlusion rates, {ERCP} complication rates and outcomes, cholangitis rates and outcomes, pancreatic cancer mortality rates, and Whipple complication rates were used. Costs were based on 2004 Medicare standard allowable charges and were accrued until all patients reached an absorbing health state (death or pancreaticoduodenectomy) or 24 cycles (24 mo) ended. {RESULTS}: Average costs per patient from Monte Carlo simulation were: (1) metal f/u metal, \$19,935; (2) plastic f/u metal, 20,157 dollars; (3) metal f/u plastic, 20,871 dollars; and (4) plastic f/u plastic, 20,878 dollars. For initial plastic stents to be preferred over short-length metal stents, 70\% or more of pancreatic cancers would need to be potentially resectable by pancreaticoduodenectomy. {CONCLUSIONS}: In patients undergoing {ERCP} before definitive cancer staging, short-length {SEMS} is the preferred initial cost-minimizing strategy.},

	abstract = {Duodenopancreatectomy with preservation of the tail for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is not contraindicated by age except in case of comorbidity. Curative excision is contraindicated in case of metastasis to the liver, peritoneum or distal nodes or in case of arterial invasion. Inversely, isolated venous invasion is not incompatible with curative surgery if one can accept the potential overmortality due to the vascular risk. Palliative surgery may be indicated for tumors limited to the pancreas in selected patients as it appears to improve survival and quality of life over derivation surgery. Preoperative biliary drainage using an endoscopic, a percutaneous or a surgical approach increases the rate of surgical complications and mortality and should be avoided, especially when the resectability of the tumor is not formally established. Wide node dissection does not modify prognosis after excision and would not be warranted on the basis of current data. Preserving the pyloris increases the rate of postoperative gastroparesia without bringing the expected nutritional advantages. It is not warranted in this indication. The type of pancreas anastomosis (pancreatogastric or pancreatojejunal) does not modify the incidence of complications or pancreatic fistulae. The rate of pancreatic fistulae and postoperative complications is decreased by preventive administration of octreotide, particularly when the pancreas is healthy. The prevalence of postoperative gastroparesia is decreased by preventive treatment with intravenous erythromycin.

	abstract = {Overwhelming surgical stress exceeding a patient's reserve capacity causes a disruption of homeostasis, leading to various postoperative complications. This study was undertaken to develop a new scoring system, "E-{PASS}", standing for the Estimation of Physiologic Ability and Surgical Stress, that predicts the postsurgical risk by quantification of the patient's reserve and surgical stress. E-{PASS} comprises the preoperative risk score ({PRS}), the surgical stress score ({SSS}), and the comprehensive risk score ({CRS}) that is determined by both scores. These scores were computed by a multiple regression analysis conducted on 292 consecutive patients who underwent elective common gastrointestinal operations at one hospital between 1992 and 1995 (internal group). The usefulness of the scores was evaluated in 989 consecutive patients who underwent the same surgical procedures during the same period at another hospital (external group). The morbidity and mortality rates increased similarly in both groups as the {CRS} increased. A marked step-up of both rates was observed at a {CRS} {\textgreater} 1.0, reaching mortality rates of 20\% in the internal subjects and 28.5\% in the external subjects. These results suggest that the E-{PASS} scoring system is reproducible, and that it may be useful for surgical decision making.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Measurement of the systemic inflammatory response in malignancy has been recently refined using a selective combination of C-reactive protein and albumin (modified Glasgow Prognostic Score, {mGPS}). This has prognostic value in patients with metastatic kidney cancer. This study examines the prognostic value  of the {mGPS} in patients undergoing curative nephrectomy for clear cell cancer. {METHODS}: Patients with localised renal cell carcinoma undergoing potentially curative resection between March 1997 and July 2007 in a single institution were  prospectively studied. The {mGPS}, University of California Los Angeles Integrated  Staging System ({UISS}), 'Stage Size Grade Necrosis' ({SSIGN}), Kattan and Leibovich  scores were constructed. {RESULTS}: A total of 169 patients were studied. The minimum follow-up was 49 months; the median follow-up of the survivors was 98 months. During this period, 35 patients died of their cancer; a further 24 patients died of intercurrent disease. On univariate survival analysis of the scoring systems, Kattan (P{\textless}0.05), {UISS} (P{\textless}0.001), {SSIGN} (P{\textless}0.001) and Leibovich (P{\textless}0.001) were significantly associated with cancer-specific survival. Using cancer-specific mortality at 4 years as an endpoint, the area under the receiver  operator curve was 0.726 (95\% {CI} 0.629-0.822; P=0.001) for Kattan, 0.776 (95\% {CI}  0.671-0.880; P{\textless}0.001) for {UISS}, 0.812 (95\% {CI} 0.733-0.892; P{\textless}0.001) for {SSIGN}, 0.778 (95\% {CI} 0.666-0.889; P{\textless}0.001) for Leibovich and 0.800 (95\% {CI} 0.687-0.912;  P{\textless}0.001) for the {mGPS} scoring system. On multivariate analysis of significant independent scoring systems and {mGPS}, {UISS} ({HR} 3.08, 95\% {CI} 1.54-6.19, P=0.002) and {mGPS} ({HR} 5.13, 95\% {CI} 2.89-9.11, P{\textless}0.001) were significant independent predictors of cancer-specific survival. {CONCLUSIONS}: The present prospective study shows that the {mGPS}, an inflammation-based prognostic score, is at least equivalent to and independent of other current validated prognostic scoring systems for patients undergoing curative nephrectomy for renal clear cell cancer. The {mGPS} is simple, measured preoperatively, based on well-standardised, widely available protein assays, and therefore provides an objective and rational basis  before treatment for future staging systems in patients with operable renal cancer.},

The area under the receiver-operating characteristic ({ROC}) curve for cancer-specific survival was 0.650 for the {NLR} and 0.640 for the {dNLR}. The {NLR} and {dNLR} were independently associated with survival  in all cancers studied (all P{\textless}0.001). The optimal thresholds, on the basis of hazard ratios and area under the curve, were 4 : 1 for the {NLR} and 2 : 1 for the  {dNLR}. {CONCLUSION}: The results of the present study show that the {dNLR} has similar prognostic value to the {NLR}. Therefore, the universally available {dNLR} is to be commended for use in the risk stratification of patients undergoing chemotherapy.},

	abstract = {Traditional open surgical necrosectomy for treatment of infected pancreatic necrosis is associated with high morbidity and mortality, leading to a shift toward minimally invasive endoscopic, radiologic, and laparoscopic approaches. Percutaneous drainage is useful as a temporizing method to control sepsis and as an adjunctive treatment to surgical intervention. It is limited because of the requirement for frequent catheter care and the need for repeated procedures. Endoscopic transgastric or transduodenal therapies with endoscopic debridement/necrosectomy have recently been described and are highly successful in carefully selected patients. It avoids the need for open necrosectomy and can be used in poor operative candidates. Laparoscopic necrosectomy is also promising for treatment of pancreatic necrosis. However, the need for inducing a pneumoperitoneum and the potential risk of infection limit its usefulness in patients with critical illness. Retroperitoneal access with a nephroscope is used to directly approach the necrosis with complete removal of a sequestrum. Retroperitoneal drainage using the delay-until-liquefaction strategy also appears to be successful to treat pancreatic necrosis. The anatomic location of the necrosis, clinical comorbidities, and operator experience determine the best approach for a particular patient. Tertiary care centers with sufficient expertise are increasingly using minimally invasive procedures to manage pancreatic necrosis.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Recent studies have indicated that preoperative biliary drainage ({PBD}) should not be routinely performed in patients suffering from obstructive jaundice before surgery. The severity of jaundice that mandates {PBD} has yet to be defined. Our aim was to investigate whether {PBD} is truly justified in severely jaundiced patients before pancreaticoduodenectomy. The parameters evaluated were overall morbidity, length of hospital stay, and total in-hospital mortality.
{METHODS}: From January 2000 to December 2012, a total of 240 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary tumors. Group A comprised 76 patients with preoperative serum bilirubin ≥15 mg/dl who did not undergo {PBD} before surgery. Group B comprised another 76 patients, matched for age and tumor localization (papillary vs. pancreatic head) who underwent {PBD} 2-4 weeks before pancreaticoduodenectomy and were identified from the same database.
{RESULTS}: Less operative time was required in the 'no {PBD}' group compared with the '{PBD}' group (210 vs. 240 min). Total intraoperative blood loss and blood transfusions were also significantly less in the 'no {PBD}' group. There was no difference detected in the rate of pancreatic fistula or biliary fistula formation. Group A patients demonstrated significantly lower morbidity than group B (24 vs. 36 \%, respectively) and therefore required briefer hospitalization (11 vs. 16 days). Mild infectious complications appear to be the main factor that enhanced morbidity in the {PBD} group. However, total in-hospital mortality was not significantly different between the two groups.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Even severe jaundice should not be considered as an indication for {PBD} before pancreaticoduodenectomy, as {PBD} increases infections and postoperative morbidity, therefore delaying definite treatment.},

This aim of this systematic review was to assess the predictive value of the {POSSUM} models in colorectal cancer surgery. {METHODS}: Major electronic databases, including Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library  and Pubmed were searched for original studies published between 1991 and 2010. Two independent reviewers assessed each study against inclusion and exclusion criteria. All data was specific to colorectal cancer surgery. Predictive value was assessed by calculating observed to expected (O/E) ratios. {RESULTS}: Nineteen  studies were included in final review. The mortality analysis included ten studies (4,799 patients) on {POSSUM}, 17 studies (6,576 patients) on P-{POSSUM} and 14 studies (5,230 patients) on {CR}-{POSSUM}. Weighted O/E ratios for mortality were  0.31 ({CI} 0.31-0.32) for {POSSUM}, 0.90 ({CI} 0.88-0.92) for P-{POSSUM} and 0.64 ({CI} 0.63-0.65) for {CR}-{POSSUM}. The morbidity analysis included four studies (768 patients) on {POSSUM} with a weighted O/E ratio of 0.96 ({CI} 0.94-0.98). {CONCLUSIONS}: P-{POSSUM} was the most accurate model for predicting post-operative mortality after colorectal cancer surgery.

	abstract = {Background Patient-associated co-morbidities are a potential cause of postoperative complications. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Project ({NSQIP}) collects data on patient outcomes to provide risk-adjusted outcomes data to participating hospitals. However, operations which may have a high distribution of technically-related complications, such as pancreatic operations, may not be adequately assessed using such predictive models. Methods A combined data set of {NSQIP} Public Use files ({PUF}) from 2005 to 2008 was created. Using this database, multiple logistic regression analyses were used to generate a predictive model of 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality for pancreatic operations and all other operations recorded in {NSQIP}. Receiver-operator characteristic curves were generated and the area under those curves ({AUROC}) used to generate a c-statistic to assess the model’s discriminatory ability. Observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios of for mortality and morbidity using not only patient-associated co-morbidities, but operation-associated information, such as work relative-value units and Current Procedural Terminology codes, were generated. Data were analyzed in {SPSS}. Results In the 4-year period analyzed, there were 7,097 complex pancreatic procedures done which were compared to 568,371 procedures that were not. For postoperative mortality, the {AUROC} was less for pancreatic operations (0.741) compared to all other operation (0.947) and all other inpatient operations (0.927). Similarly for postoperative morbidity, the {AUROC} was less for pancreatic operations (0.598) compared to all other operations (0.764) and all other inpatient operations (0.817). However, the O/E ratios were similar in both groups for mortality (all other operations, 0.94 vs. pancreatic operations, 0.92) and morbidity (0.98 for both). Conclusions These data imply that the factors used to assess postoperative mortality and morbidity may not completely explain postoperative outcomes in pancreatic operations. These procedures are technically demanding and can have morbidities not related to pre-existing co-morbid conditions; therefore, preoperative prediction based on pre-existing co-morbidities may have limitations in these types of operations.},

After 3, 7, 14 and 21 days, the animals were sacrificed, and some serum enzyme activities, histological changes in the liver, and the coupling efficiency of mitochondria isolated from the liver were investigated. The phosphorylating ability of hepatic mitochondria was more seriously affected when the obstruction was complicated by cholangitis. We suggest that, when associated with obstructive jaundice, biliary infection should be carefully treated prior to hepatectomy.},

Early markers of septic complications would be useful for diagnosis and therapeutic management in patients with postoperative sepsis. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between early (first postoperative day) changes in interleukin 6 ({IL}-6), procalcitonin ({PCT}) and C-reactive protein ({CRP}) serum concentrations and the occurrence of subsequent septic complications after major surgery.
{METHODS}: Serial blood samples were collected from 50 consecutive patients for determination of {IL}-6, {PCT} and {CRP} serum levels. Blood samples were obtained on the morning of surgery and on the morning of the first postoperative day.
{RESULTS}: Sixteen patients developed septic complications during the first five postoperative days (group 1), and 34 patients developed no septic complications (group 2). On day 1, {PCT} and {IL}-6 levels were significantly higher in group 1 (P-values of 0.003 and 0.006, respectively) but {CRP} levels were similar. An {IL}-6 cut-off point set at 310 pg ml(-1) yielded a sensitivity of 90\% and a specificity of 58\% to differentiate group 1 patients from group 2 patients. When associated with the occurrence of {SIRS} on day 1 these values reached 100\% and 79\%, respectively. A {PCT} cut-off point set at 1.1 ng ml(-1) yielded a sensitivity of 81\% and a specificity of 72\%. When associated with the occurrence of {SIRS} on day 1, these values reached 100\% and 86\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {PCT} and {IL}-6 appear to be early markers of subsequent postoperative sepsis in patients undergoing major surgery for cancer. These findings could allow identification of postoperative septic complications.},

	abstract = {To elucidate the mechanism of liver mitochondrial dysfunction induced by obstructive jaundice, the following experiments were performed. In vivo study: Using Wistar male rats, bile ducts were ligated, and serum levels of total bilirubin (T-Bil), {GOT}, {GPT}, mitochondrial {GOT} ({mGOT}) and total bile acids ({TBA}) were measured at 3 and 7 days after the ligation. Then, the liver was isolated to determine mitochondrial functions and to measure the content of fatty acids in mitochondrial phospholipids by high performance liquid chromatography. The levels of T-Bil, {GOT}, {GPT}, {mGOT} and {TBA} were elevated by the bile duct ligation. Mitochondrial functions were deteriorated, and contents of arachidonic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid in mitochondrial phospholipids decreased. Pretreatment with coenzyme Q10 (E-0216, {CoQ}10), an antidetergent agent, prevented not only the development of mitochondrial dysfunction and the decrease in mitochondrial phospholipids but also the elevation of {GOT}, {GPT}, and {mGOT} although {CoQ}10 did not prevent the elevation of T-Bil and {TBA} levels. In vitro study: Using intact rat liver mitochondria, the effect of taurocholic acid ({TCA}), one of the physiological bile salts, on the mitochondrial function and on mitochondrial phospholipids was examined. Incubation of mitochondria with {TCA} induced a dose-dependent deterioration of mitochondrial function and the increase in the content of solubilized phospholipids. The protective effect of {CoQ}10 was also observed in the in vitro study. These results indicate that degradation of mitochondrial phospholipids by bile acids is responsible for the early phase of liver dysfunction induced by obstructive jaundice.},

Abstract {BACKGROUND}: We planned to investigate the effect of preoperative short period intensive physical therapy on lung functions, gas-exchange, and capacity of diffusion, and ventilation-perfusion distribution of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. {METHODS}: Sixty patients with lung cancer, who were deemed operable, were randomly allocated into two groups. Intensive physical therapy was performed in patients in the study group before operation. Both groups received routine physical therapy after operation. {RESULTS}: There was no difference in pulmonary function tests between the two groups. Intensive physical therapy statistically significantly increased peripheral blood oxygen saturation. At least one complication was noted in 5 patients (16.7\%) in the control group, and 2 (6.7\%), in the study group. However, there was no statistically significant difference (p = 0,4). The hospital stay has been found to be statistically significantly shortened by intensive physical therapy (p {\textless}0.001). Ventilation-perfusion distribution was found to be significantly effected by intensive physical therapy. The change was prominent in the the contralateral lung (p {\textless}0.001). {CONCLUSIONS}: Intensive physical therapy appeared to increase oxygen saturation, reduce hospital stay, and change the ventilation/perfusion distribution. It had a significant, positive effect on the exercise capacity of patients.},

This study investigated the utility of the level of serum amylase on the night of surgery [postoperative day ({PoD}) 0 serum amylase] to predict {POPF}. {METHODS}: A total of 185 patients who underwent {PD} were studied. Occurrences of {POPF} were graded using the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula ({ISGPF}) classification. Receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) analysis  identified a threshold value of {PoD} 0 serum amylase associated with clinically significant {POPF} ({ISGPF} Grades B and C) in a test cohort (n = 45). The accuracy of this threshold value was then tested in a validation cohort (n = 140). {RESULTS}: Overall, 43 (23.2\%) patients developed clinically significant {POPF}. The  threshold value of {PoD} 0 serum amylase for the identification of clinically significant {POPF} was {\textgreater}/= 130 {IU}/l (P = 0.003). Serum amylase of {\textless}130 {IU}/l had a negative predictive value of 88.8\% for clinically significant {POPF} (P {\textless} 0.001). Serum amylase of {\textgreater}/= 130 {IU}/l on {PoD} 0 and a soft pancreatic parenchyma were independent risk factors for clinically significant {POPF}. {CONCLUSIONS}: Postoperative day 0 serum amylase of {\textless}130 {IU}/l allows for the early and accurate  categorization of patients at least risk for clinically significant {POPF} and may  identify patients suitable for early drain removal.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Pancreatoduodenectomy ({PD}) is associated with high incidence of morbidity and mortality. We have applied P-{POSSUM} in predicting the incidence of outcome after {PD} to identify those who are at the highest risk of developing complications. {METHOD}: A prospective database of 241 consecutive patients who had {PD} from January 2002 to September 2005 was retrospectively updated and analysed. P-{POSSUM} score was calculated for each patient and correlated with observed morbidity and mortality. {RESULTS}: 30 days mortality was 7.8\% and morbidity was 44.8\%. Mean physiological score was 16.07 +/- 3.30. Mean operative score was 13.67 +/- 3.42. Mean operative score rose to 20.28 +/- 2.52 for the complex major operation (p {\textless} 0.001) with 2 fold increase in morbidity and 3.5 fold increase in mortality. For groups of patients with a physiological score of (less than or equal to) 18, the O:P (observed to Predicted) morbidity ratio was 1.3-1.4 and, with a physiological score of {\textgreater}18, the O:P ratio was nearer to 1. Physiological score and white cell count were significant in a multivariate model. {CONCLUSION}: P-{POSSUM} underestimated the mortality rate. While P-{POSSUM} analysis gave a truer prediction of morbidity, underestimation of morbidity and potential for systematic inaccuracy in prediction of complications at lower risk levels is a significant issue for pancreatic surgery.},

	abstract = {{AIM}: To evaluate the influence of preoperative biliary drainage on morbidity and mortality after surgical resection for ampullary carcinoma. {METHODS}: We analyzed retrospectively data for 82 patients who underwent potentially curative surgery for ampullary carcinoma between September 1993 and July 2007 at the Singapore General Hospital, a tertiary referral hospital. Diagnosis of ampullary carcinoma was confirmed histologically. Thirty-five patients underwent preoperative biliary drainage ({PBD} group), and 47 were not drained (non-{PBD} group). The mode of biliary drainage was endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (n = 33) or percutaneous biliary drainage (n = 2). The following parameters were analyzed: wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess, intra-abdominal or gastrointestinal bleeding, septicemia, biliary or pancreatic leakage, pancreatitis, gastroparesis, and re-operation rate. Mortality was assessed at 30 d (hospital mortality) and also long-term. The statistical endpoint of this study was patient survival after surgery. {RESULTS}: The groups were well matched for demographic criteria, clinical presentation and operative characteristics, except for lower hemoglobin in the non-{PBD} group (10.9 +/- 1.6 vs 11.8 +/- 1.6 in the {PBD} group). Of the parameters assessing postoperative morbidity, incidence of wound infection was significantly less in the {PBD} than the non-{PBD} group [1 (2.9\%) vs 12 (25.5\%)]. However, the rest of the parameters did not differ significantly between the groups, i.e. sepsis [10 (28.6\%) vs 14 (29.8\%)], intra-abdominal bleeding [1 (2.9\%) vs 5 (10.6\%)], intra-abdominal abscess [1 (2.9\%) vs 8 (17\%)], gastrointestinal bleeding [3 (8.6\%) vs 5 (10.6\%)], pancreatic leakage [2 (5.7\%) vs 3 (6.4\%)], biliary leakage [2 (5.7\%) vs 3 (6.4\%)], pancreatitis [2 (5.7\%) vs 2 (4.3\%)], gastroparesis [6 (17.1\%) vs 10 (21.3\%)], need for blood transfusion [10 (28.6\%) vs 17 (36.2\%)] and re-operation rate [1 (2.9\%) vs 5 (10.6\%)]. There was no early mortality in either group. Median survival was 44 mo (95\% {CI}: 34.2-53.8) in the {PBD} group and 41 mo (95\% {CI}: 27.7-54.3; P = 0.86) in the non-{PBD} group. {CONCLUSION}: Biliary drainage before surgery for ampullary cancer significantly reduced postoperative wound infection. Overall mortality was not influenced by preoperative drainage.},

Therefore, identification of patients at high risk of poor outcome after surgery for stage {II} colon cancer is desirable. This study aims to  validate a clinical risk score to predict cancer-specific survival in patients undergoing surgery for stage {II} colon cancer. Patients undergoing surgery for stage {II} colon cancer in 16 hospitals in the West of Scotland between 2001 and 2004 were identified from a prospectively maintained regional clinical audit database. Overall and cancer-specific survival rates up to 5 years were calculated. A total of 871 patients were included. At 5 years, cancer-specific survival was 81.9\% and overall survival was 65.6\%. On multivariate analysis, age  {\textgreater}/=75 years (hazard ratio ({HR}) 2.11, 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) 1.57-2.85; P{\textless}0.001) and emergency presentation ({HR} 1.97, 95\% {CI} 1.43-2.70; P{\textless}0.001) were independently associated with cancer-specific survival. Age and mode of presentation {HRs} were added to form a clinical risk score of 0-2. The cancer-specific survival at 5 years for patients with a cumulative score 0 was 88.7\%, 1 was 78.2\% and 2 was 65.9\%. These results validate a modified simple clinical risk score for patients undergoing surgery for stage {II} colon cancer. The combination of these two universally documented clinical factors provides a solid foundation for the examination of the impact of additional clinicopathological and treatment factors on overall and cancer-specific survival.},

Pathological data were taken from the reports at that time. {RESULTS}: Low-grade inflammatory infiltrate assessed using Klintrup's criteria was an independent prognostic factor in node-negative disease. In patients with a low-risk Petersen Index (n=179), low-grade infiltrate carried a threefold increased risk of cancer death. Low-grade infiltrate was related to increasing T stage and an infiltrating margin. {CONCLUSION}: Assessment of inflammatory infiltrate using Klintrup's criteria provides independent prognostic information on node-negative colorectal cancer.

There were repeated measurements of nitrogen balance and whole-body protein turnover ({WBPT}) using a bolus 15N-glycine method on the morning of days 3, 6, and 9. Principal findings were as follows: (1) increasing the supply of {AAs} significantly improves nitrogen balance in {AIDS} patients; (2) there is no simple  linear effect of increasing amounts of {AAs} on {WBPT} in {AIDS} patients; (3) {WBPT} is  high and variable in these patients; and (4) mean {WBPT} of each patient is significantly correlated with body cell mass ({BCM}) as a proportion of {BW} (P {\textless} .001, r = .92). We conclude that poor nutritional status in {AIDS} patients with weight loss is associated with high {WBPT}.

	abstract = {Background

Surgical reconstruction following pancreaticoduodenectomy ({PD}) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Because of great variability in definitions of specific complications, it remains unclear whether there is a difference in complication rates following the two commonest types of reconstruction, pancreaticogastrostomy ({PG}) and pancreaticojejunostomy ({PJ}). Published consensus definitions for postoperative pancreatic fistula ({POPF}) have led to a series of randomized clinical trials ({RCTs}) uniquely placed to address this question.


Methods

A literature search was carried out to identify all {RCTs} comparing postoperative complications of {PG} versus {PJ} reconstruction following {PD} published between January 1995 and December 2013. Pooled odds ratios ({ORs}) with 95 percent confidence intervals (c.i.) were calculated using fixed-effect or random-effects models.


Results

In total, seven {RCTs} with 1121 patients were included. Four of these trials applied definitions as published by the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula ({ISGPF}). Using {ISGPF} definitions, the incidence of {POPF} was lower in patients undergoing {PG} than in those having {PJ} ({OR} 0·50, 95 per cent c.i. 0·34 to 0·73; P {\textless} 0·001). Using definitions applied by each individual study, {PG} was associated with significantly lower rates of {POPF} ({OR} 0·51, 0·36 to 0·71; P {\textless} 0·001), intra-abdominal fluid collection ({OR} 0·50, 0·34 to 0·74; P {\textless} 0·001) and biliary fistula ({OR} 0·42, 0·18 to 0·93; P = 0·03) than {PJ}.


Conclusion

Meta-analysis of four {RCTs} based on {ISGPF} criteria, and seven {RCTs} using non-standard criteria, revealed that {PG} reduced the incidence of {POPF} after {PD} compared with {PJ}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Several well-established tumour prognostic factors are used to guide  the clinical management of patients with breast cancer. Lymphovascular invasion and angiogenesis have also been reported to have some promise as prognostic factors. The aim of the present study was to examine the prognostic value of tumour lymphovascular invasion and microvessel density compared with that of established prognostic factors in invasive ductal breast cancer. {METHODS}: In addition to hormone receptor status and Ki-67 proliferative activity, lymphovascular invasion and microvessel density and their relationship with survival were examined in patients with invasive ductal breast cancer. Full sections and tissue microarrays (n = 384 patients) were utilised to assess these  factors and were scored by appropriate methods. {RESULTS}: On univariate analysis tumour size (P {\textless} 0.05), lymph node involvement (P {\textless} 0.01), lymphovascular invasion (P {\textless} 0.05), microvessel density (P {\textless} 0.05) and local- regional treatment (P {\textless} 0.01) were associated with poorer survival in {ER} negative tumours. On multivariate analysis in {ER} negative tumours lymph node involvement (P {\textless} 0.01) and local- regional treatment (P {\textless} 0.05) were independently associated with poorer cancer-specific survival. On univariate analysis tumour grade (P {\textless} 0.05),  lymph node involvement (P {\textless} 0.001), {HER}-2 (P {\textless} 0.05), Ki-67 (P {\textless} 0.01) and lymphovascular invasion (P {\textless} 0.001) were associated with poorer survival in {ER} positive tumours. On multivariate analysis lymph node involvement (P {\textless} 0.001), Ki-67 (P {\textless} 0.001) and lymphovascular invasion (P {\textless} 0.05) were independently associated with poorer cancer-specific survival in {ER} positive tumours. {CONCLUSION}: Lymphovascular invasion but not microvessel density was independently associated with poorer survival in patients with {ER} positive but not {ER} negative  invasive ductal breast cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Obstructive jaundice is associated with enhanced susceptibility to hypotensive shock, renal failure, and toxic effects of endotoxin, which results in high perioperative morbidity and mortality. Since the normal arterial baroreflex function is necessary for hemodynamic homeostasis and improving survival in sepsis, this study aimed to determine whether baroreflex sensitivity was impaired in jaundiced patients. {METHODS}: Thirty-five patients with obstructive jaundice scheduled for surgery were included, and 30 nonjaundiced patients served as controls. A modified Oxford pharmacologic technique was used for evaluating baroreflex sensitivity immediately before the surgery. Potential factors that may affect baroreflex sensitivity in jaundice, such as liver biochemistry, plasma concentrations of methionine-enkephalin, atrial natriuretic peptide and nitrate, were also measured. {RESULTS}: Patients with obstructive jaundice had decreased sensitivity in both the sympathetic and vagal components of the baroreflex, as compared with the controls (P {\textless} 0.01). There was a significant inverse correlation between plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration and decreased sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity in the jaundiced group (r = -0.44, P = 0.008). {CONCLUSIONS}: Baroreflex sensitivity is impaired in patients with obstructive jaundice, which may contribute to their enhanced susceptibility to the well-known perioperative complications. The underlying mechanisms for such a change may be associated with an increased level of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: The presence of bacteria in the bile of patients undergoing biliary tract surgery has been proposed as associated to an increased incidence of postoperative complications. The present study was designed to determine whether colonization of the bile has an adverse effect in terms of postoperative infectious or noninfectious complications and mortality in a homogenous population of patients suffering from periampullary region malignancies, who all underwent resectional (curative) procedures. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Between January 1997 and December 2002, 115 patients (n = 115) suffering from periampullary region malignancies underwent resectional procedures. Fifty-two of the above patients were referred having undergone preoperative internal biliary drainage. During the operation, bile was routinely isolated from the common bile duct and was sent for culture and sensitivity. Based on the bile culture results, the patients were divided in sterile and colonized group and were retrospectively compared in terms of postoperative outcome and mortality. {RESULTS}: Of the 115 bile cultures, 67 were colonized with bacteria and 48 were sterile. Postoperatively, 40 patients developed 35 noninfectious and 21 infectious complications. Univariate analysis did not disclose statistically significant differences in overall, noninfectious or infectious morbidity and mortality between the two groups of patients. Although not statistically significant, a higher incidence (22 vs 10\%) of postoperative leaks in the colonized group of patients was noticed. Multiple regression analysis disclosed that colonized bile was independently related to the advanced age, preoperative biliary drainage presence, elevated preoperative serum bilirubin levels and low preoperative serum albumin levels but did not predispose to an increased postoperative morbidity, mortality, or reoperation rate. {CONCLUSION}: The present study did not conclude in any statistically significant differences in the postoperative infectious and noninfectious morbidity as well as mortality, between colonized and sterile groups of patients who underwent resectional procedures for malignancies of the periampullary region. Although internal biliary drainage introduces microorganisms into the biliary tree, this colonization does not increase the risk of either infectious or noninfectious complications or postoperative death. Thus, the likelihood of bacterobilia should not contraindicate the procedure in selected cases.},

We have made pulmonary function tests and treadmill exercise with serial venous sampling of blood lactate, piruvate, ketone bodies, free fatty acids and creatinkinase. {RESULTS}: Patients with {MM} showed exercise limitation with lower maximal power ({MM} = 143 [47] vatts, C = 187 [40] vatts, p = 0.006), maximal oxygen uptake ({MM} = 27 [8] ml/min/kg, C = 40 [7] ml/min/kg, p = 0.001) and maximal oxygen pulse ({MM} = 11 [3] ml/beat, C = 14 [3] ml/beat, p = 0.006). For the same oxygen uptake the heart rate was higher and the anaerobic threshold was earlier in {MM} patients ({MM} = 48\% [14], C = 62\% [12], p = 0.01). We found a considerable slower maximal oxygen uptake in patients with lipid increase in muscle biopsy (n = 15). Acetoacetate curves, beta-hydroxybutyrate, free fatty acids and creatinkinase were similar in both groups. The exercise test was pathologic in 17/26 of the patients. The sensitivity of the exercise test for maximal oxygen uptake was 0.65. {CONCLUSIONS}: The cardiopulmonary exercise test is a useful test in the suspect initial diagnostic of patients with mild mitochondrial myopathy because the majority of patients show a pathologic test.},

Although surgery cannot guarantee a cure, the 5-year survival does improve to around 10\% following resection and increases to 20-30\% with adjuvant chemotherapy. The European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer ({ESPAC}) 1 trial was the first adequately powered, randomized study to assess chemoradiotherapy ({CRT}), concurrent with 5-fluorouracil (5-{FU}) and chemotherapy [5-{FU}/folinic acid ({FA})] in resected pancreatic cancer. There was a survival benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy, but not for adjuvant {CRT}. Adjuvant {CRT} also did not improve survival in the {EORTC} multicenter prospective randomized trial by Klinkenbijl et al. (1999). The phase 3 {RTOG} 9704 trial compared pre- and postchemoradiation gemcitabine to pre- and postchemoradiation 5-{FU}. Overall there was no difference in overall survival between the 2 arms. Adjuvant gemcitabine significantly improved disease-free survival and later overall survival compared to surgery alone in the {CONKO}-001 randomized trial. The {ESPAC}-3(v2) trial compared adjuvant gemcitabine versus 5-{FU}/{FA}. The final 2-year analysis demonstrated median survival from resection of patients treated with 5-{FU}/{FA} was 23.0 months (95\% {CI}: 21.1, 25.0) and 23.6 months (95\% {CI}: 21.4, 26.4) for patients treated with gemcitabine. Further randomized studies will assess the role of adjuvant combination chemotherapy ({ESPAC}-4). The key to the future of adjuvant therapy in pancreatic cancer will be the identification of novel and effective agents, and better biomarker technology underpinned by translational research which will inform the design of future trials.},

	abstract = {Background Pancreatectomy for cancer continues to have substantial perioperative risk, and the factors affecting mortality are ill defined. An integer-based risk score based on national data might help clarify the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing pancreatic resection. Methods Records with the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer were queried from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for 1998–2006. Procedures were categorized as proximal, distal, or nonspecified pancreatectomies on the basis of {ICD}-9 codes. Logistic regression and bootstrap methods were used to create an integer risk score for estimating the risk of in-hospital mortality using patient demographics, comorbidities (Charlson comorbidity score), procedure, and hospital type. A random sample of 80\% of the cohort was used to create the risk score with a 20\% internal validation set. Results A total of 5715 patient discharges were identified. Composite in-hospital mortality was 5.8\%. Predictors used for the final model were age group, Charlson score, sex, type of pancreatectomy, and hospital volume status (low-, medium-, or high-volume center). Integer values were assigned to these characteristics and then used for calculating an additive score. Three clinically useful score groups were defined to stratify the risk of in-hospital mortality (mortality was 2.0, 6.2, and 13.9\%, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001), with a 6.95-fold difference between the low- and high-risk groups. There was sufficient discrimination of both the derivation set and the validation set, with c statistics of 0.71 and 0.72, respectively. Conclusions An integer-based risk score can be used to accurately predict in-hospital mortality after pancreatectomy and may be useful for preoperative risk stratification and patient counseling.},

	abstract = {Prognostic stratification in squamous cell carcinoma ({SCC}) of the head and neck has traditionally relied on the pathological staging of a tumour, but it is increasingly being recognised that host-related factors have an important role in the assessment of survival and recurrence. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of systemic inflammation scores including the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score ({mGPS}) in patients undergoing potentially curative resection for oral {SCC}.  We retrospectively identified 178 patients who had curative operations for cancer of the oral cavity and soft palate between January 2006 and April 2011. Among the inclusion criteria were preoperative estimates of C-reactive protein and serum albumin. We analysed established pathological prognostic factors and scores for systemic inflammation as predictors of cancer-specific and overall survival. On univariate analysis, the {mGPS} was a significant predictor of both cancer-specific (p{\textless}0.001) and overall survival (p{\textless}0.001), and it remained an independent predictor of cancer-specific ({HR}: 2.12, 95\% {CI} 1.49 to 3.00; p{\textless}0.001) and overall survival ({HR}: 1.69, 95\% {CI} 1.23 to 2.31; p=0.001) on Cox regression analysis.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To determine whether preoperative biliary instrumentation and preoperative biliary drainage are associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates after pancreaticoduodenectomy. {SUMMARY} {BACKGROUND} {DATA}: Pancreaticoduodenectomy is accompanied by a considerable rate of postoperative complications and potential death. Controversy exists regarding the impact of preoperative biliary instrumentation and preoperative biliary drainage on morbidity and mortality rates after pancreaticoduodenectomy. {METHODS}: Two hundred forty consecutive cases of pancreaticoduodenectomy performed between January 1994 and January 1997 were analyzed. Multiple preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were examined. Pearson chi square analysis or Fisher's exact test, when appropriate, was used for univariate comparison of all variables. Logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. {RESULTS}: One hundred seventy-five patients (73\%) underwent preoperative biliary instrumentation (endoscopic, percutaneous, or surgical instrumentation). One hundred twenty-six patients (53\%) underwent preoperative biliary drainage (endoscopic stents, percutaneous drains/stents, or surgical drainage). The overall postoperative morbidity rate after pancreaticoduodenectomy was 48\% (114/240). Infectious complications occurred in 34\% (81/240) of patients. Intraabdominal abscess occurred in 14\% (33/240) of patients. The postoperative mortality rate was 5\% (12/240). Preoperative biliary drainage was determined to be the only statistically significant variable associated with complications (p = 0.025), infectious complications (p = 0.014), intraabdominal abscess (p = 0.022), and postoperative death (p = 0.037). Preoperative biliary instrumentation alone was not associated with complications, infectious complications, intraabdominal abscess, or postoperative death. {CONCLUSIONS}: Preoperative biliary drainage, but not preoperative biliary instrumentation alone, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. This suggests that preoperative biliary drainage should be avoided whenever possible in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic and peripancreatic lesions. Such a change in current preoperative management may improve patient outcome after pancreaticoduodenectomy.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Obesity is an independent risk factor for pancreatic cancer development and progression, although the mechanisms underlying this association are completely unknown. The aim of the current study was to investigate the influence of obesity on pancreatic cancer growth using a novel in vivo model.
{METHODS}: Lean (C57BL/6 J) and obese (Lep(Db) and Lep(Ob)) mice were inoculated with murine pancreatic cancer cells ({PAN}02), and studied after 5 weeks of tumor growth. Tumor histology was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining, cellular proliferation was assessed by 5-bromodeoxyuridine, and apoptosis was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay. Serum adiponectin, leptin, and insulin levels were assayed.
{RESULTS}: Obese mice developed larger tumors, and a significantly greater number of mice developed metastases; mortality was also greater in obese mice. Tumor apoptosis did not differ among strains, but tumors from both obese strains had greater proliferation relative to those growing in lean animals. Serum adiponectin concentration correlated negatively and serum insulin concentration correlated positively with tumor proliferation. Intratumoral adipocyte mass in tumors from both obese strains was significantly greater than that in tumors of lean mice.
{CONCLUSION}: Data from this novel in vivo model suggest that the altered adipokine milieu and insulin resistance observed in obesity may lead directly to changes in tumor microenvironment, thereby promoting pancreatic cancer growth and dissemination.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Surgical resection is the treatment of choice to cure patients with non-small-cell lung cancer ({NSCLC}); nevertheless, the assessment of the lower limit of surgical tolerance remains difficult. Ventilatory inefficiency (measured as the ventilation to {CO}(2) production ratio (V'(E)/V'({CO}2) slope) is a survival predictor in pulmonary hypertension ({PH}) and chronic heart failure ({CHF}) and is considered a marker of {PH} in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of V'(E)/V'({CO}2) slope as preoperative mortality and morbidity predictor in {COPD} patients submitted to lung resection for {NSCLC} and considered operable according to current standards. {METHODS}: A retrospective analysis was performed in 145 consecutive {COPD} patients with lung cancer (128 males and 17 females), with a mean age of 64 years (range: 41-82 years) who were referred for preoperatory evaluation. Because of bronchial obstruction or reduced pulmonary diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (D(L,{CO})), all these patients were considered operable only after a cardiopulmonary exercise test showed a preserved cardiopulmonary function. {RESULTS}: A total of 98 lobectomies, eight bilobectomies and 39 pneumonectomies (13 left and 26 right) were performed. Twenty-one patients (14.5\%) suffered severe cardio-respiratory complications; 15/106 patients (14.2\%) after lobectomy/bilobectomy and 6/39 (15.4\%) after pneumonectomy. Five patients (3.4\%) died within 30 days after surgery (3/106 after lobectomy/bilobectomy (2.8\%) and 2/39 after pneumonectomy (5.1\%)). Considering all functional parameters before surgery and the postoperative predicted values, a logistic regression analysis individuated the V'(E)/V'({CO}2) slope as the only independent mortality predictor (odds ratio ({OR}): 1.24 z=2.77; p{\textless}0.007). The V'(O2 peak) was instead the best predictor for the occurrence of severe cardiopulmonary postoperative complications ({OR}: 0.05, z=-2.39, p{\textless}0.02). {CONCLUSIONS}: In {COPD} patients, a high V'(E)/V'({CO}2) slope before lung resection is an independent mortality predictor even in the presence of an acceptable cardiopulmonary performance. {COPD} patients with high V'(E)/V'({CO}2) slope before surgery must be carefully screened to exclude pulmonary hypertension, especially before surgical procedures with large parenchymal exeresis.},

We describe especially the limitations and advantages of risk in stratifying the patients. {METHODS}: We investigated 177 randomly chosen patients undergoing elective complex {HPB} surgery in a single institution with a total of 71 pre-operative and intra-operative risk factors. Primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality and morbidity. Ordered logistic regression analysis was used to identify individual predictors of operative morbidity and mortality. {RESULTS}: The operative mortality in the series was 3.95\%. This compared well with the p-{POSSUM} and {APACHE} predicted mortality of 4.31\% and 4.29\% respectively. Post-operative complications amounted to 45\% with 24 (13.6\%) patients having a major adverse event. On multivariate analysis the pre-operative {POSSUM} physiological score ({OR} = 1.18, P = 0.009) was superior in predicting complications compared to the {ASA} (P = 0.108), {APACHE} (P = 0.117) or Childs classification (P = 0.136). In addition, serum sodium, creatinine, international normalized ratio ({INR}), pulse rate, and intra-operative blood loss were independent risk factors. A combination of the {POSSUM} variables and {INR} offered the optimal combination of risk factors for risk prognostication in {HPB} surgery. {CONCLUSION}: Morbidity for elective {HPB} surgery can be accurately predicted and applied in everyday surgical practice as an adjunct in the process of informed consent and for effective allocation of resources for intensive and high-dependency care facilities.},

In the 115 jaundiced patients 33 had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy, 50 had bypass operation and the remaining 32 patients undergone percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage ({PTBD}) only. No operative mortality happened for the 33 pancreaticoduodenectomies. Postoperative complications occurred in 12 patients. Leakage from the choledochojejunostomy was the most often occurred complications, it was found in 7 patients (21.2\%). Intraabdominal abscesses happened in six patients (18.2\%) which recovered by treating with ultrasound-guided catheteral drainage. Leakage from pancreaticojejunostomy was also found in five patients (15.2\%), the complication recovered uneventfully after administration of total parenteral nutrition and good abdominal drainage. Twenty-two out 33 patients with pancreaticoduodenectomy received preoperative biliary drainage. However, despite preoperative biliary drainage, 10 of 22 patients (45.5\%) still suffered postoperative complications. It implied that hyperbilirubinemia would trend to carry a high postoperative morbility. The prognosis for our patients with pancreatic head carcinoma was extremely poor. The mean survival period for all of them was not exceeding 12 months. Those who had {PTBD} as the sole treatment had the shortest survival period, which was 3.4 +/- 3.1 months only. On the other hand, the mean survival period for those who had periampullary cancer and had pancreaticoduodenectomy was 35.5 +/- 27.2 months, while it was 13.3 +/- 10.1 and 11.8 +/- 10.0 months for those having bypass operation and {PTBD} respectively.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 250 {WORDS})},

We also wished to explore the relationship between comorbidity, {mGPS} and Performance Status ({PS}). In addition we investigated a number of standard prognostic markers and demographics. This study aimed to determine which of these factors most accurately predicted survival. {METHODS}: Between 2005 and 2008 all newly diagnosed lung cancer patients coming through the Multi-Disciplinary Teams ({MDTs}) in four Scottish Centres were  included in the study. Patient demographics, World Health Organization/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, clinico-pathological features, {mGPS}, comorbidity and proposed primary treatment modality were recorded. Univariate survival analysis was carried out using Kaplan-Meier method and the log rank test. {RESULTS}: This large unselected population based cohort study of lung cancer patients has demonstrated that a number of important factors have significant impact in terms of survival. It has gone further by showing that the  factors which influence survival are different, depending upon the stage of cancer at diagnosis and the potential treatment strategy. The novel comorbidity scoring system, the {SCSS}, has compared very favourably with the more established  {CCI}. {CONCLUSION}: This study has identified that a variety of factors are independent prognostic determinants of outcome in lung cancer.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: To determine the effects of preoperative exercise training on cardiorespiratory fitness in patients undergoing thoracic surgery for malignant lung lesions. {METHODS}: Using a single-group design, 25 patients with suspected operable lung cancer were provided with structured exercise training until surgical resection. Exercise training consisted of 5 endurance cycle ergometry sessions per week at intensities varying from 60\% to 100\% of baseline peak oxygen consumption ({VO}(2 peak)). Participants underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing, 6-minute walk (6 {MW}), and pulmonary function testing at baseline, immediately before, and 30 days after surgical resection. {RESULTS}: Five patients were deemed ineligible before surgical resection and were removed from the analysis. Of the remaining 20 patients follow-up assessments were obtained for 18 (90\%) before resection and 13 (65\%) patients postresection. The overall adherence rate was 72\%.

There is some evidence that a higher modified Glasgow Prognostic Score ({mGPS}) may be associated with poorer survival in patients with prostate cancer but it is not known whether this is independent of other established prognostic factors. Therefore the aim of this study was to describe the relationship between {mGPS} and survival in patients with prostate cancer after adjustment for other prognostic factors. {METHODS}: Retrospective clinical series on patients in Glasgow, Scotland, for whom data from the Scottish Cancer Registry, including Gleason score, Prostate Specific Antigen ({PSA}), C-reactive protein ({CRP}) and albumin, six months prior to or following the diagnosis, were included in this study. {RESULTS}: Seven hundred and forty four prostate cancer patients were identified; of these, 497 (66.8\%) died during a maximum follow up of 11.9 years.

	abstract = {Background
Serum C-reactive protein ({CRP}) is an established discriminating factor for necrotizing pancreatitis. In this study, the {CRP} response with respect to inflammatory postoperative complications was examined in a large, homogeneous series of pancreatic resections in order to define a relevant clinical parameter for early detection of inflammatory postoperative complications.
Methods
688 consecutive pancreatic resections with jejunal anastomosis were screened for inflammatory postoperative complications based on a prospective database. Ninety-one patients had at least one inflammatory postoperative complication and were compared to a subgroup of 60 consecutive patients with uneventful postoperative courses.
Results
In the postoperative setting after pancreatic resection, {CRP} peaked on postoperative day ({POD}) 3 with a median serum {CRP} of 132 mg/L, and gradually decreased thereafter in patients with an uncomplicated postoperative course. In complicated cases (with the exception of cholangitis), increase in {CRP} was significantly greater, peaked on {POD} 3 (median {CRP} 173 mg/L), and persisted thereafter, whereas white blood cell count and body temperature did not differ significantly from uneventful courses until {POD} 6. The median day of diagnosis of inflammatory postoperative complications was {POD} 9. A cutoff {CRP} value of 140 mg/{dL} on {POD} 4 yielded a positive predictive value of 89.1\% (adjusted to the prevalence of inflammatory postoperative complications: 48.7\%) with a specificity of 87.1\% and a sensitivity of 69.5\% for inflammatory postoperative complications.
Conclusion
Persistence of {CRP} elevation above 140 mg/{dL} on {POD} 4 is predictive of inflammatory postoperative complications and should prompt an intense clinical search for major septic processes (e.g. pancreatic fistula or abscess) if pneumonia and wound infection are unlikely or excluded.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Whether ampullary neoplasms are best surgically managed by pancreaticoduodenectomy versus local ampullectomy is controversial. We sought to examine the outcome of patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy versus ampullectomy, as well as to identify factors predictive of lymph node metastasis in patients with ampullary neoplasms. {METHODS}: Between 1970 and 2007, 450 patients who underwent surgical resection of ampullary adenoma or adenocarcinoma were identified from a prospective, single-institution database. Data on clinicopathologic factors, morbidity, mortality, and survival were analyzed. {RESULTS}: The initial surgical procedure was pancreaticoduodenectomy in 96.7\% patients and ampullectomy in 3.3\%. Final diagnosis was invasive adenocarcinoma (77.1\%) or adenoma (22.9\%). Median tumor size was similar for adenomas associated with an adenocarcinoma (2.5 cm) versus adenomas without invasive cancer (2.9 cm; P=0.71). Morbidity was comparable with pancreaticoduodenectomy (52.2\%) versus ampullectomy (33.3\%; P=0.15), as was 30-day mortality (pancreaticoduodenectomy, 2.1\% versus ampullectomy, 0\%; P=0.6). Metastatic disease to regional lymph nodes was present in 54.5\% patients with adenocarcinoma. Factors associated with presence of lymph node metastasis included tumor size {\textgreater} or = 1 cm ({OR} 2.1), poor histologicgrade ({OR} 4.8), perineural invasion ({OR} 3.0), microscopic vessel invasion ({OR} 6.6), and depth of invasion {\textgreater} {pT}1 ({OR} 4.3; all P{\textless}0.05). Specifically, risk of lymph node metastasis increased with T stage (T1, 28.0\%; T2, 50.9\%; T3, 71.7\%; T4, 77.3\%; P{\textless}0.001). {CONCLUSION}: When surgery is indicated, radical resection is required for early invasive adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater, as lymph node metastases are present in nearly 30\% of patients with T1 disease. Pancreaticoduodenectomy should be the preferred approach for most ampullary neoplasms that require surgical resection.},

The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between clinico-pathological status, preoperative C-reactive protein concentration and cancer-specific survival in patients undergoing resection for gastro-oesophageal cancer. One hundred and twenty patients attending the upper gastrointestinal surgical unit in the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, who were selected for potentially curative surgery, were included in the study. Laboratory measurements of haemoglobin, white cell, lymphocyte and platelet counts, albumin and C-reactive protein were carried out at the time of diagnosis. All patients underwent en-bloc resection with lymphadenectomy and survived at least 30 days following surgery. On multivariate analysis, only the positive to total lymph node ratio (hazard ratio ({HR}) 2.02, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.44-2.84, P{\textless}0.001) and preoperative C-reactive protein concentration ({HR} 3.53, 95\% {CI} 1.88-6.64, P{\textless}0.001) were independent predictors of cancer-specific survival.

{RESULTS}: Forty-three patients developed deep incisional or organ/space surgical site infections. The groups with and without infection were comparable. Multivariate analysis showed that only Dukes' stage (p=0.048) and postoperative infection (p=0.011) were independently associated with outcome. In patients with infective complications, the survival rate was significantly lower than in subjects without infection (log rank p=0.0004).

	abstract = {Excess {CO}2 is generated when lactate is increased during exercise because its [H+] is buffered primarily by {HCO}-3 (22 ml for each meq of lactic acid). We developed a method to detect the anaerobic threshold ({AT}), using computerized regression analysis of the slopes of the {CO}2 uptake ({VCO}2) vs. O2 uptake ({VO}2) plot, which detects the beginning of the excess {CO}2 output generated from the buffering of [H+], termed the V-slope method. From incremental exercise tests on 10 subjects, the point of excess {CO}2 output ({AT}) predicted closely the lactate and {HCO}-3 thresholds. The mean gas exchange {AT} was found to correspond to a small increment of lactate above the mathematically defined lactate threshold [0.50 +/- 0.34 ({SD}) meq/l] and not to differ significantly from the estimated {HCO}-3 threshold. The mean {VO}2 at {AT} computed by the V-slope analysis did not differ significantly from the mean value determined by a panel of six experienced reviewers using traditional visual methods, but the {AT} could be more reliably determined by the V-slope method. The respiratory compensation point, detected separately by examining the minute ventilation vs. {VCO}2 plot, was consistently higher than the {AT} (2.51 +/- 0.42 vs. 1.83 +/- 0.30 l/min of {VO}2). This method for determining the {AT} has significant advantages over others that depend on regular breathing pattern and respiratory chemosensitivity.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Preoperative biliary drainage ({PBD}) prior to pancreaticoduodenectomy ({PD}) continues to be routine in many centers despite retrospective and randomized data showing that {PBD} increases perioperative infectious complications. {METHODS}: Review of a prospectively maintained database identified 340 consecutive patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent {PD} between 2000 and 2005. From this cohort, 94 {PBD} and 94 nonstented (no-{PBD}) patients were matched for age, gender, preoperative albumin, and bilirubin levels ({PBD} group: prestent bilirubin; no-{PBD} group: preoperative bilirubin). {RESULTS}: The majority of {PBD} patients (89\%) underwent internal endoscopic biliary drainage. Stent-related complications occurred in 46 patients (23\%) and resulted in a significant delay in time to resection. In the matched-pair comparison, there was more operative blood loss in {PBD} patients, but similar operative times, transfusions, and hospital stay. Bile cultures were positive in 82\% of {PBD} patients versus 7\% no {PBD}. There was a statistically significant increase in infectious complications including wound infections and intra-abdominal abscess in {PBD} patients, but equal incidence of anastomotic leak. {CONCLUSIONS}: In this case-matched control study, {PBD} was associated with a stent-related complication rate of 23\% and resulted in a twofold increase in postpancreatectomy infectious complications.

	abstract = {Background Surgical patients with poor functional capacity, determined by oxygen consumption at anaerobic threshold ({AT}) during cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}), experience longer hospital stays and worse short- and medium-term survival. However, previous studies excluded patients who were unable to perform a {CPET} or who failed to demonstrate an {AT}. We hypothesized that such patients are at risk of inferior outcomes after elective surgery.
Methods All patients undergoing major colorectal surgery attempted {CPET} to assist in the planning of care. Patients were stratified by their test results into Fit ({AT} ≥ 11.0 ml O2 kg−1 min−1), Unfit ({AT} {\textless} 11.0 ml O2 kg−1 min−1), or Unable to {CPET} groups (failed to pedal or demonstrate an {AT}). For each group, we determined hospital stay and mortality.
Results Between March 2009 and April 2010, 269 consecutive patients were screened, and proceeded to bowel resection. Median hospital stay was 8 days ({IQR} 5.1–13.4) and there were 44 deaths (16\%) at 2 yr; 26 (9.7\%) patients were categorized as Unable to {CPET}, 69 (25.7\%) Unfit and 174 (64.7\%) Fit. There were statistically significant differences between the three groups in hospital stay [median ({IQR}) 14.0 (10.5–23.8) vs 9.9 (5.5–15) vs 7.1 (4.9–10.8) days, P {\textless} 0.01] and mortality at 2 yr [11/26 (42\%) vs 14/69 (20\%) vs 19/174 (11\%), respectively (P {\textless} 0.01)] although the differences between Unable and Unfit were not statistically different.
Conclusions Patients' inability to perform {CPET} is associated with inferior outcomes after major colorectal surgery. Future studies evaluating {CPET} in risk assessment for major surgery should report outcomes for this subgroup.},

This study was designed to analyze the incidence and risk factors for post-pancreaticoduodenectomy ({PD}) morbidity/mortality in a multi-institutional cohort of {BR}-C patients.
{METHODS}: Elective {PDs} were evaluated from the 2005-10 {ACS}-{NSQIP} database. {BR}-C was defined as age ≥ 80, poor {PS}, weight loss {\textgreater} 10 \%, pulmonary disease, recent myocardial infarction/angina, stroke history, and/or preoperative sepsis. Variables associated with 30-day postoperative major complications ({PMC}) and mortality were analyzed.
{RESULTS}: A total of 3,033/8,266 (36.7 \%) patients were {BR}-C. {BR}-C patients were more likely to suffer {PMC} (31.3 vs. 26.2 \%) and mortality (4.1 vs. 2.3 \%). {BR}-C patients with {PMC} suffered 50 \% higher mortality versus non-{BR}-C patients with {PMC} (11.5 vs. 7.7 \%) (all p {\textless} 0.001).

{CONCLUSIONS}: Nationwide, one third of patients undergoing {PD} are medically borderline. These {BR}-C patients are at higher risk for and less able to be rescued from {PMC}.

Our aim was to prospectively evaluate the prognostic value of tumor- and patient-related factors including the systemic inflammatory response in patients undergoing potentially curative surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the head of pancreas. {METHODS}: The prognostic impact of  tumor factors such as stage and host factors, including the systemic inflammatory response (modified Glasgow Prognostic Score [{mGPS}]), were evaluated in a prospective study of 135 patients who underwent elective pancreaticoduodenectomy  for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from January 2002 to April 2009. {RESULTS}: In addition to the established tumor-related pathological factors (in particular margin involvement; hazard ratio [{HR}] 2.82, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.65-4.84, P {\textless} 0.001), an elevated {mGPS} ({HR} 2.26, 95\% {CI} 1.43-3.57, P {\textless} 0.001) was independently associated with lower overall survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Additionally, in an adjuvant therapy subgroup of 74 patients, both margin involvement and an elevated {mGPS} remained independently associated with reduced overall survival. {CONCLUSIONS}: We have prospectively validated the influence of tumor-related and patient-related factors. Margin involvement and the preoperative {mGPS} were the most important determinants of overall survival in patients undergoing potentially curative pancreaticoduodenectomy. Furthermore, both had independent prognostic value in those patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. In the future, this may be considered a stratification factor for entry onto therapeutic trials.},

We reviewed 1423 patients who underwent a {PD} for a malignancy originating in the pancreas at our institution between 1970 and 2006. We examined 1175 {PDs} for ductal adenocarcinomas in greater detail. Eighteen different histological types of pancreatic cancer were identified; the most common diagnoses included ductal adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, and {IPMN} with invasive cancer. Patients with ductal adenocarcinoma were analyzed in detail. The median age was 66 years, with patients in the present decade significantly older (68 years), on average, than patients in the three prior decades (e.g., 60 years in 1970, P = 0.02). The median tumor diameter was 3 cm; 42\% of the resections had positive margins and 78\% had positive lymph nodes. The perioperative morbidity was 38\%. The median postoperative stay declined over time, from 16 days in the 1980s to 8 days in the 2000s (P {\textless} 0.001). The perioperative mortality declined from 30\% in the 1970s to 1\% in the 2000s (P {\textless} 0.001). The median survival for all patients with ductal adenocarcinoma was 18 months (1-year survival = 65 \%, 2-year survival = 37\%, 5-year survival = 18\%). In a Cox proportional hazards model, pathological factors having a significant impact on survival included tumor diameter, resection margin status, lymph node status, and histologic grade. This is the largest single-institution experience with {PD} for pancreatic cancer. Patients who have cancers with favorable pathological features have a statistically significant improved long-term survival.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A duodenojejunostomy ({DJ}) or gastrojejunostomy ({GJ}) leak is a potentially fatal complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy ({PD}). However, due to its rarity, this complication has not been fully characterized. {METHODS}: We reviewed 3,029 {PDs} performed at our institution over a 26-year period and identified patients who suffered a leak at the {DJ} or {GJ} anastomosis. Perioperative data from patients with such a leak were examined in detail and were compared to patients who did not experience such a leak after {PD}. {RESULTS}: A total of 13 patients experienced a {DJ} or {GJ} leak after {PD}, amounting to a 0.4\% leak rate. Common clinical signs of a leak included an acute abdomen, enterocutaneous fistula, and a fever. Twelve of thirteen patients also had a leukocytosis, with five patients having a peak white blood cell count exceeding 30,000 cells/mm(3). The median time interval between surgery and diagnosis of the {DJ} or {GJ} leak was 10 days; three patients were diagnosed after being discharged from the hospital and one patient was diagnosed on the day of their planned discharge. In a multivariate model, perioperative risk factors for a {DJ} or {GJ} leak included a preoperative {BUN}-to-creatinine ratio {\textgreater} 20 (odds ratio = 6, p = 0.01), intraoperative blood loss {\textgreater} or =1 l (odds ratio = 6, p = 0.03), and a total pancreatectomy (odds ratio = 7, p = 0.005). In the {DJ} or {GJ} leak group, 12 of 13 patients were managed operatively. The median postoperative length of stay was 35 days after {PD}, and four patients died within 4 months of surgery as a result of their complicated postoperative course. {CONCLUSION}: {DJ} or {GJ} leaks occur infrequently after {PD}, but are associated with substantial morbidity. The clinical presentation is usually delayed, and surgical management is the preferred approach. Early diagnosis, attention to preoperative volume status, and continued efforts to control blood loss may minimize the impact of {DJ} or {GJ} leaks in some instances.},

	abstract = {Purpose To evaluate cardiopulmonary function (as measured by peak oxygen consumption [{VO}2peak]) across the breast cancer continuum and its prognostic significance in women with metastatic disease.
Patients and Methods Patients with breast cancer representing four cross-sectional cohorts—that is, (1) before, (2) during, and (3) after adjuvant therapy for nonmetastatic disease, and (4) during therapy in metastatic disease—were studied. A cardiopulmonary exercise test ({CPET}) with expired gas analysis was used to assess {VO}2peak. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk of death according to {VO}2peak category ({\textless} 15.4 v ≥ 15.4 {mL} · kg−1 · min−1) with adjustment for clinical factors.
Results A total of 248 women (age, 55 ± 8 years) completed a {CPET}. Mean {VO}2peak was 17.8 ± a standard deviation of 4.3 {mL} · kg−1 · min−1, the equivalent of 27\% ± 17\% below age-matched healthy sedentary women. For the entire cohort, 32\% had a {VO}2peak less than 15.4 {mL} · kg−1 · min−1—the {VO}2peak required for functional independence. {VO}2peak was significantly different across breast cancer cohorts for relative ({mL} · kg−1 · min−1) and absolute (L · min−1) {VO}2peak (P = .017 and P {\textless} .001, respectively); {VO}2peak was lowest in women with metastatic disease. In patients with metastatic disease (n = 52), compared with patients achieving a {VO}2peak ≤ 1.09 L · min−1, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 0.32 (95\% {CI}, 0.16 to 0.67, P = .002) for a {VO}2peak more than 1.09 L · min−1.
Conclusion Patients with breast cancer have marked impairment in {VO}2peak across the entire survivorship continuum. {VO}2peak may be an independent predictor of survival in metastatic disease.},

Relative survival and relative excess risk of death from cancer were calculated for each of 17 health areas in New South Wales, Australia. There were statistically significant differences in survival across areas for both cancers after adjusting for demographic factors. The variation remained for colon cancer but was reduced for rectal cancer after adjustment for spread of disease at diagnosis. This persistent variation in colon cancer survival suggests that variation in treatment contributes to it, and there is separate evidence for such variation. Of the 7186 patients whose deaths within five years were attributable to colorectal cancer, 784 could have had their survival increased to more than five years if the excess risk of death in all areas was reduced to the 20th centile of its distribution.

	abstract = {The most important diagnostic step in the management of patients with severe acute pancreatitis is the discrimination between acute interstitial and necrotizing pancreatitis. Measurement of C-reactive protein, lactic acid dehydrogenase, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and alpha-2-macroglobulin and contrast-enhanced {CT} are useful in detecting the necrotizing course of acute pancreatitis. C-reactive protein, lactic acid dehydrogenase, and contrast-enhanced {CT} offer detection rates of 85 per cent to more than 90 per cent for pancreatic necrosis. Surgical decision-making in necrotizing pancreatitis should be based on clinical, morphologic, and bacteriologic data. Patients with focal pancreatic necrosis, in general, respond well to medical treatment and do not need surgery. Extended (50 per cent or more) pancreatic necroses, infected necroses, and intrapancreatic parenchymal necroses plus extrapancreatic fatty tissue necroses are indicators for surgical management. The decision for the timing of operation in patients with proved necrotizing pancreatitis should be based on clinical criteria: the development of an acute surgical abdomen, generalized sepsis, shock, persisting or increasing organ dysfunction, or some combination thereof despite maximum intensive care treatment for at least 3 days. Major pancreatic resection for the treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis appears disadvantageous. Necrosectomy and continuous local lavage allow debridement of devitalized tissue and preservation of vital pancreatic tissue. Postoperative local lavage thus results in an atraumatic evacuation of necrotic tissue, the bacterial material, and biologically active substances. The hospital mortality rate of patients treated with necrosectomy and continuous local lavage (the Ulm protocol) is below 10 per cent. Nevertheless, controlled prospective clinical trials should be performed in order to bring more precision to our clinical decisions in respect to the role of surgery for this disease.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Perioperative beta-blockade is widely used, especially before vascular surgery; however, its impact on exercise performance assessed using cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) in this group is unknown. We hypothesized that beta-blocker therapy would significantly improve {CPET}-derived physical fitness in this group.
{METHODS}: We recruited patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms ({AAA}) of {\textless}5.5 cm under surveillance. All patients underwent {CPET} on and off beta-blockers. Patients routinely prescribed beta-blockers underwent a first {CPET} on medication. Beta-blockers were stopped for one week before a second {CPET}. Patients not routinely taking beta-blockers underwent the first {CPET} off treatment, then performed a second {CPET} after commencement of bisoprolol for at least 48 h. Oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) at estimated lactate threshold ([Formula: see text]) and [Formula: see text] at peak were primary outcome variables. A linear mixed-effects model was fitted to investigate any difference in adjusted {CPET} variables on and off beta-blockers.
{RESULTS}: Forty-eight patients completed the study. No difference was observed in [Formula: see text] at [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] at peak; however, a significant decrease in [Formula: see text] at [Formula: see text] and peak, an increase in workload at [Formula: see text], O2 pulse and heart rate both at [Formula: see text] and peak was found with beta-blockers. Patients taking beta-blockers routinely (chronic group) had worse exercise performance (lower [Formula: see text]).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Beta blockade has a significant impact on {CPET}-derived exercise performance, albeit without changing [Formula: see text] at [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] at peak. This supports performance of preoperative {CPET} on or off beta-blockers depending on local perioperative practice.

	abstract = {{AIM}: To analyze the risk factors for pancreatic leakage after pancreaticoduodenectomy ({PD}) and to evaluate whether duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy could reduce the risk of pancreatic leakage. {METHODS}: Sixty-two patients who underwent {PD} at our hospital between January 2000 and November 2003 were reviewed retrospectively. The primary diseases of the patients included pancreas cancer, ampullary cancer, bile duct cancer, islet cell cancer, duodenal cancer, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cystadenoma, and gastric cancer. Standard {PD} was performed for 25 cases, {PD} with extended lymphadenectomy for 27 cases, pylorus-preserving {PD} for 10 cases. A duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy was performed for patients with a hard pancreas and a dilated pancreatic duct, and a traditional end-to-end invagination pancreaticojejunostomy for patients with a soft pancreas and a non-dilated duct. Patients were divided into two groups according to the incidence of postoperative pancreaticojejunal anastomotic leakage: 10 cases with leakage and 52 cases without leakage. Seven preoperative and six intraoperative risk factors with the potential to affect the incidence of pancreatic leakage were analyzed with {SPSS}10.0 software. Logistic regression was then used to determine the effect of multiple factors on pancreatic leakage. {RESULTS}: Of the 62 patients, 10 (16.13\%) were identified as having pancreatic leakage after operation. Other major postoperative complications included delayed gastric emptying (eight patients), abdominal bleeding (four patients), abdominal abscess (three patients) and wound infection (two patients). The overall surgical morbidity was 43.5\% (27/62). The hospital mortality in this series was 4.84\% (3/62), and the mortality associated with pancreatic fistula was 10\% (1/10). Sixteen cases underwent duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy and 1 case (1/16, 6.25\%) developed postoperative pancreatic leakage, 46 cases underwent invagination pancreaticojejunostomy and 9 cases (9/46, 19.6\%) developed postoperative pancreatic leakage. General risk factors including patient age, gender, history of jaundice, preoperative nutrition, pathological diagnosis and the length of postoperative stay were similar in the two groups. There was no statistical difference in the incidence of pancreatic leakage between the patients who received the prophylactic use of octreotide after surgery and the patients who did not undergo somatostatin therapy. Moreover, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that none of the above factors seemed to be associated with pancreatic fistula. Two intraoperative risk factors, pancreatic duct size and texture of the remnant pancreas, were found to be significantly associated with pancreatic leakage. The incidence of pancreatic leakage was 4.88\% in patients with a pancreatic duct size greater than or equal to 3 mm and was 38.1\% in those with ducts smaller than 3 mm (P = 0.002). The pancreatic leakage rate was 2.94\% in patients with a hard pancreas and was 32.1\% in those with a soft pancreas (P = 0.004). Operative time, blood loss and type of resection were similar in the two patient groups. The incidence of pancreatic leakage was 6.25\% (1/16) in patients with duct-to-mucosa anastomosis, and was 19.6\% (9/46) in those with traditional invagination anastomosis. Although the difference of pancreatic leakage between the two groups was obvious, no statistical significance was found. This may be due to the small number of patients with duct-to-mucosa anastomosis. By further analyzing with multivariate logistic regression, both pancreatic duct size and texture of the remnant pancreas were demonstrated to be independent risk factors (P = 0.007 and 0.017, {OR} = 11.87 and 15.45). Although anastomotic technique was not a significant factor, pancreatic leakage rate was much less in cases that underwent duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy. {CONCLUSION}: Pancreatic duct size and texture of the remnant pancreas are risk factors influencing pancreatic leakage after {PD}. Duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy, as a safe and useful anastomotic technique, can reduce pancreatic leakage rate after {PD}.},

Recognized prognostic factors for resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDAC}) include tumour size, differentiation, resection margin involvement and lymph node metastases. A further prognostic factor of less certain significance is lymphocyte count. The aim of this study was to investigate whether preoperative lymphocyte count is a prognostic indicator in patients with {PDAC}. Material and methods. Patients who had undergone a potentially curative pancreaticoduodenectomy ({PD}) for {PDAC} between 1998 and 2005 were analysed. Standard prognostic factors, preoperative lymphocyte count, preoperative neutrophil count and survival data were collected. Results. Of the 44 patients studied, univariate analysis identified predictors of a poor survival as lymph node status (node positive (+ve) 10.3 [5.4–20.9] months versus node negative (−ve) 14.2 [10.9–31.4] months; p=0.038), posterior resection margin invasion (margin +ve 7.0 [5.1–15.0] months versus margin −ve 13.1 [10.0–28.3] months; p=0.025) and lymphocyte count below the reference range ({\textless}1.5×109/litre 8.8 [7.0–13.1] months versus ≥1.5×109/litre 14.3 [7.0–28.3] months; p=0.029). Low preoperative lymphocyte count (p=0.027) and posterior margin invasion (p=0.023) retained significance on multivariate analysis. Preoperative neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was not a significant prognostic factor. Conclusion. Preoperative lymphocyte count is a significant prognostic factor in patients with {PDAC}.},

	url = {http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18154928},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The Physiologic and Operative Severity Score for the {enUmeration} of Mortality and Morbidity ({POSSUM}) is a predictive scoring system for postoperative morbidity. While numerous studies validate its application to major abdominal surgery, few exclusively consider pancreatic resections, whose unique complications are costly and problematic. We examined whether {POSSUM} could accurately reflect clinical and economic outcomes in pancreatic resection. {METHODS}: 326 consecutive pancreatic resections (227 pancreaticoduodenectomies, 87 distal, 7 central, and 5 total pancreatectomies) were performed between October 2001 and January 2007. {POSSUM} score was prospectively calculated for each case, and patients were stratified to quintiles of morbidity risk: {\textless} or = 20\%, 20-40\%, 40-60\%, 60-80\%, {\textgreater} or = 80\%. Actual clinical and economic outcomes were compared across the groups. Predictive risk assessment was further evaluated independently within each resection type. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify specific {POSSUM} parameters predictive of postoperative morbidity. {RESULTS}: Observed and Expected morbidity rates were equivalent (53.1\% vs 55.5\%) with an overall O/E ratio of 0.96. Although no patients presented with {POSSUM} scores below 20\%, a relatively equal distribution was assigned to the remaining risk cohorts. Clinical and economic outcomes progressively worsened with escalations in {POSSUM} scores. Increasing morbidity risk was associated with significantly longer hospital stays, higher rates of complications, and more blood transfusions, {ICU} management, and discharge to rehabilitation facilities. This had considerable economic impact, as mean hospital costs rose from \$19,951 in the 20-40\% risk cohort, to \$31,281 in the {\textgreater} or = 80\% group. Breakdown by operation type demonstrates that {POSSUM} definitively predicts morbidity following both proximal and distal resection, but more accurately forecasts the need for {ICU} management and rehabilitation placement when pancreatoduodenectomy is performed. Multivariate analysis revealed that one-half of {POSSUM} parameters were significant contributors for postoperative morbidity, with age, preoperative hemoglobin concentration, and intraoperative blood loss demonstrating the strongest correlations. {CONCLUSION}: {POSSUM} is a valuable perioperative scoring system for evaluating variance in pancreatic surgical methods and outcomes, and can be employed to guide management decisions that impact postoperative recovery.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}/{AIMS}: Recent studies suggest that preoperative placement of bile duct stents increases morbidity after pancreatic surgery. The influence of pancreatic duct stenting on outcome after pancreatic surgery is unknown. {METHODOLOGY}: The records of 264 consecutive patients who underwent lateral pancreaticojejunostomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy, or distal pancreatectomy for chronic pancreatitis were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. {RESULTS}: There were 137 patients who received preoperative endoscopic pancreatic stents. The remainder underwent preoperative {ERCP} without stent placement. Both groups had a similar stage of disease measured by endoscopic, clinical, and histological findings. The overall postoperative morbidity was higher in the stent group (19.7\% vs. 42.3\%, p{\textless}0.001, odds ratio 3.0). Intra-abdominal complications occurred more frequently in the stent group (10.2\% vs. 32.8\%, p{\textless}0.001), including a difference in pancreatic leaks. There was no difference in extra-abdominal complications (10.2\% vs. 13.1\%) and mortality (1.6\% vs. 1.5\%). {CONCLUSIONS}: Patients who undergo pancreatic duct stenting and require surgical drainage at a later point have a threefold increased risk for peri-operative complications. An increase in intra-abdominal complications might be related to stent associated pancreatic duct injuries, stent occlusion, and bacterial colonization of the stent.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To examine the prognostic implications of routine elastica staining for venous invasion on prediction of cancer-specific survival in colorectal cancer. {SUMMARY} {BACKGROUND} {DATA}: Venous invasion is an important high risk feature in colorectal cancer, although prevalence in published studies ranges from 10\% to 90\%. To resolve the disparity, elastica stains have been used in our  institution to provide a more objective judgment since 2002. {METHODS}: The study included 419 patients undergoing curative elective colorectal cancer resection between 1997 and 2006. Patients were grouped prior to (1997-2001 [cohort 1]) and  following the introduction of elastica staining (2003-2006 [cohort 2]). {FINDINGS}: Clinicopathologic characteristics and 3-year survival rates were similar in both  groups. Rate of detected venous invasion increased from 18\% to 58\% following introduction of elastica staining (P {\textless} 0.001). The 3-year cancer-specific survival rate associated with the absence of venous invasion was 84\% in cohort 1, compared with 96\% in cohort 2 (P {\textless} 0.01). Elastica staining improved the prognostic value of venous invasion, showing the area under the receiver operator curve rising from 0.59 (P = 0.040; 1997-2001) to 0.68 (P {\textless} 0.001; 2003-2006), using cancer mortality as an end point. A direct comparison between H\&E alone and elastica Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) was made in 53 patients. The area under the  receiver operator curve increased from 0.58, P = 0.293 (H\&E alone) to 0.74, P = 0.003 for venous invasion detected using the elastica method. {CONCLUSIONS}: Increased detection of venous invasion with elastica staining, compared with H\&E  staining, provides superior prediction of cancer survival in colorectal cancer. This relationship was seen in the comparison of 2 consecutive cohorts and in a direct comparison in a single cohort. Based on these results, elastica staining should be incorporated into the routine pathologic assessment of venous invasion  in colorectal cancer.},

Hypovolaemia is considered to be a cause of renal hypoperfusion, which is associated with a decreased clearance of serum urea and creatinine. This study examines whether the perioperative serum urea and creatinine concentrations are predictors of mortality in patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. {METHODS}: Consecutive patients (n=300) who underwent  emergency abdominal surgery were studied. Age- and sex-specific reference intervals were used for the data analysis. Patients with incomplete biochemical (n=51) or mortality data (n=31) or with pre-existing renal failure (n=9) were excluded from the analysis. {RESULTS}: 209 patients were analysed, of whom 162 (78\%) remained alive and 47 (22\%) died following surgery.

Patients with a diagnosis of colorectal (n = 182), gastric (n = 87), breast (n = 99), or bronchogenic (n = 404) cancer and who had measurements of C-reactive protein and albumin were identified. Median survival,  from the time of sampling, ranged from 478 days in the colorectal cancer patients to 60 days in patients with bronchogenic cancer. On univariate analysis, there was, in each tumor type, a significant relationship between the duration of survival and both log10 C-reactive protein and albumin concentrations (P {\textless} or = 0.0002). On multivariate analysis, in each tumor type, log10 C-reactive protein remained a significant independent predictor of survival (P {\textless} or = 0.0002).

Game theory is an economic system of strategic behavior, often referred to as the “theory of social situations.” Very little has been written in the medical literature about game theory or its applications, yet the practice of surgery and the operating room environment clearly involves multiple social situations with both cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors.
Methods
A comprehensive review was performed of the medical literature on game theory and its medical applications. Definitive resources on the subject were also examined and applied to surgery and the operating room whenever possible.
Results
Applications of game theory and its proposed dilemmas abound in the practicing surgeon's world, especially in the operating room environment.
Conclusion
The surgeon with a basic understanding of game theory principles is better prepared for understanding and navigating the complex Operating Room system and optimizing cooperative behaviors for the benefit all stakeholders.},

	abstract = {{AIM}: Few data are available regarding exercise testing in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm ({AAA}) disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate safety and to characterize the hemodynamic and cardiopulmonary ({CPX}) response to exercise in a large group of patients with {AAA}.
{METHODS}: Three hundred and six patients with {AAA} ≥3.0 to ≤5.0 cm (mean 72 ± 8 years) underwent {CPX} as part of a randomized trial of exercise training. {CPX} and hemodynamic responses, ischemic events, rhythm disturbances, and risk estimates based on treadmill scores were quantified and compared to an age-matched group of 2155 veterans referred for exercise testing for clinical reasons.
{RESULTS}: Peak {VO}(2) was similar between patients with {AAA} and the referral group (20.0 ± 6 ml/kg/min; 77 percent of age-predicted and 20.3 ± 7 ml/kg/min; 80 percent of age-predicted, respectively). The incidence of exercise-induced hypotension and hypertension was higher in {AAA} patients versus the referral group (2.9 and 3.6 percent vs {\textless}1.0 percent, p {\textless} 0.001), but there were no occurrences of ventricular tachycardia (≥3 beats) or other serious events in the {AAA} subjects. The Duke Treadmill Score and {VA} Treadmill Scores, which estimate annual cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality, respectively, were similar between groups.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Patients with {AAA} have a slightly higher incidence of hyper- and hypotensive responses to exercise than age-matched referrals, but no serious events related to {CPX} occurred. {AAA} patients can undergo maximal {CPX} safely and have risk scores based on treadmill test results that are similar to age-matched referral subjects. These findings extend recent studies using sub-maximal evaluations to stratify risk in patients considered for surgery, and support the routine use of exercise testing for risk evaluation and the functional assessment of patients with {AAA}.},

The hypertrophy ratio, defined as the ratio of the {FRL} volume after {PVE} to that before {PVE}, was evaluated. The bilirubin clearance also was calculated. {RESULTS}: The hypertrophy ratio was higher in patients with {SBD} than in those with {TBD} (median, 128\%; range, 111-152\% vs median, 121\%; range, 102-138\%; P = .013). The bilirubin clearance of {FRL} with {SBD} was markedly improved after {PVE} compared with that in patients with {TBD}. {CONCLUSIONS}: {SBD} is superior to {TBD} in promoting hypertrophy of the {FRL} induced by {PVE} and in guaranteeing good liver function before major hepatectomy.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}:: To develop a new international classification of acute pancreatitis severity on the basis of a sound conceptual framework, comprehensive review of published evidence, and worldwide consultation. {BACKGROUND}:: The Atlanta definitions of acute pancreatitis severity are ingrained in the lexicon of pancreatologists but suboptimal because these definitions are based on empiric description of occurrences that are merely associated with severity. {METHODS}:: A personal invitation to contribute to the development of a new international classification of acute pancreatitis severity was sent to all surgeons, gastroenterologists, internists, intensivists, and radiologists who are currently active in clinical research on acute pancreatitis. The invitation was not limited to members of certain associations or residents of certain countries. A global Web-based survey was conducted and a dedicated international symposium was organized to bring contributors from different disciplines together and discuss the concept and definitions. {RESULT}:: The new international classification of severity is based on the actual local and systemic determinants of severity, rather than description of events that are correlated with severity. The local determinant relates to whether there is (peri)pancreatic necrosis or not, and if present, whether it is sterile or infected. The systemic determinant relates to whether there is organ failure or not, and if present, whether it is transient or persistent. The presence of one determinant can modify the effect of another such that the presence of both infected (peri)pancreatic necrosis and persistent organ failure have a greater effect on severity than either determinant alone. The derivation of a classification based on the above principles results in 4 categories of severity-mild, moderate, severe, and critical. {CONCLUSIONS}:: This classification is the result of a consultative process amongst pancreatologists from 49 countries. It provides a set of concise up-to-date definitions of all the main entities pertinent to classifying the severity of acute pancreatitis in clinical practice and research. This ensures that the determinant-based classification can be used in a uniform manner throughout the world.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The optimal surgical strategy for patients presenting with colorectal liver metastases has yet to be determined. Short- and long-term outcomes must be  considered if simultaneous resection of primary and liver metastases is to gain acceptance. We examine the prognostic value of patient and tumour characteristics in predicting short- and long-term outcomes following simultaneous resection for  synchronous disease. {METHODS}: Forty-six patients undergoing simultaneous resection between April 2002 and June 2010 in a single institution were included. Patient characteristics included preoperative {ASA} grade and {POSSUM}. Tumour characteristics included {TNM} stage, Petersen Index and the Clinical Risk Score. {RESULTS}: There were no postoperative deaths. The most common complications were atrial fibrillation (seven patients) and pneumonia (seven patients). Mean hospital stay with an uncomplicated postoperative recovery was 11 days versus 17  days with complicated recovery. Age (p = 0.015), {ASA} grade (p = 0.010) and {POSSUM} score (p = 0.032) were associated with postoperative complications. No pathological characteristics of the primary or secondary tumours related to surgical morbidity. Median follow-up was 37 months (5-87) during which 24 patients died, 23 from cancer. Twenty-seven had disease recurrence. N stage of the primary (p = 0.035), high-risk Petersen Index of the primary (p = 0.010) and  Clinical Risk Score {\textgreater}/= 3 (p = 0.005) were associated with poorer recurrence-free and cancer-specific survival. {CONCLUSIONS}: Post operative morbidity was determined by patient factors rather than operative or tumour characteristics. In addition to the Clinical Risk Score, pathological characteristics of the primary  are important determinants of long-term outcome following simultaneous resection  for synchronous disease.},

	shorttitle = {The impact of comorbidity on cancer survival},
	abstract = {Background
A number of studies have shown poorer survival among cancer patients with comorbidity. Several mechanisms may underlie this finding. In this review we summarize the current literature on the association between patient comorbidity and cancer prognosis. Prognostic factors examined include tumor biology, diagnosis, treatment, clinical quality, and adherence.

Methods
All English-language articles published during 2002–2012 on the association between comorbidity and survival among patients with colon cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer were identified from {PubMed}, {MEDLINE} and Embase. Titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify eligible studies and their main results were then extracted.

Results
Our search yielded more than 2,500 articles related to comorbidity and cancer, but few investigated the prognostic impact of comorbidity as a primary aim. Most studies found that cancer patients with comorbidity had poorer survival than those without comorbidity, with 5-year mortality hazard ratios ranging from 1.1 to 5.8. Few studies examined the influence of specific chronic conditions. In general, comorbidity does not appear to be associated with more aggressive types of cancer or other differences in tumor biology. Presence of specific severe comorbidities or psychiatric disorders were found to be associated with delayed cancer diagnosis in some studies, while chronic diseases requiring regular medical visits were associated with earlier cancer detection in others. Another finding was that patients with comorbidity do not receive standard cancer treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy as often as patients without comorbidity, and their chance of completing a course of cancer treatment is lower. Postoperative complications and mortality are higher in patients with comorbidity. It is unclear from the literature whether the apparent undertreatment reflects appropriate consideration of greater toxicity risk, poorer clinical quality, patient preferences, or poor adherence among patients with comorbidity.

Conclusion
Despite increasing recognition of the importance of comorbid illnesses among cancer patients, major challenges remain. Both treatment effectiveness and compliance appear compromised among cancer patients with comorbidity. Data on clinical quality is limited.},

Measures of {AC} determined with cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) may predict survival after liver transplantation ({LT}), but the relationship with nontransplant outcomes is uncertain. In patients assessed for {LT}, we examined the relationship of {CPET} {AC} parameters with the severity of liver disease, nutritional state, and survival with and without {LT}. Patients assessed for elective first {LT} who underwent {CPET} and an anthropometric assessment at a single center were studied. {CPET}-derived measures of {AC} that were evaluated included the peak oxygen consumption ({VO}2 peak) and the anaerobic threshold ({AT}). Three hundred ninety-nine patients underwent {CPET}, and 223 underwent {LT}; 45\% of the patients had a {VO}2 peak {\textless} 50\% of the predicted value, and 31\% had an {AT} {\textless} 9 {mL}/kg/minute. The {VO}2 peak and {AT} values correlated with the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, but they more closely correlated with serum sodium and albumin levels. The handgrip strength correlated strongly with the {VO}2 peak. Patients with impaired {AC} had prolonged hospitalization after {LT}, and nonsurvivors had lower {AT} values than survivors 1 year after transplantation (P {\textless} 0.05); this was significant in a multivariate analysis. One hundred seventy-six patients did not undergo {LT}; the 1-year mortality rate was 34.6\%. The {AT} (P {\textless} 0.05) and {VO}2 peak values (P {\textless} 0.001) were lower for nonsurvivors. In a multivariate analysis, {AT} was independently associated with nonsurvival. In conclusion, {AC} was markedly impaired in many patients with {CLD}. In patients who did not undergo transplantation, impaired {AT} was predictive of mortality, and in patients undergoing {LT}, it was related to postoperative hospitalization and survival. {AC} should be evaluated as a modifiable factor for improving patient survival whether or not {LT} is anticipated.

Obstructive jaundice was induced by clamping a tube inserted into the common bile duct of rats, while at the same time Escherichia coli bacteria were introduced into the tube to induce biliary infection. After one week, the biliary obstruction was removed. After 14 days of biliary drainage, the impaired structure and function of the cholestatic liver without biliary infection were remarkably improved, having returned almost to normal, while in the cases with biliary infection, the impairments were far less improved, especially with respect to mitochondrial function. These results suggest that major hepatic surgery should not be employed in patients with obstructive jaundice in the presence of biliary infection and should be delayed until hepatic function has recovered sufficiently after biliary drainage.},

We sought to assess the influence of obesity and body fat distribution on pathologic characteristics and survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
{METHODS}: Demographic and biometric data were collected on 328 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In a subset of patients, pancreatic fatty infiltration and fibrosis were assessed pathologically, and visceral fat area ({VFA}) was evaluated.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: As patients with pancreas and periampullary cancer ({PPC}) experience improved survival rates and longevity, the focus shifts toward living life while surviving cancer. Fatigue is the most commonly reported symptom in all cancer patients. Exercise has been found to effectively decrease fatigue levels and improve physical functioning in cancer patients. {STUDY} {DESIGN}: One hundred two patients with resected {PPC} consented to participate in this study and were randomized to either an intervention group ({IG}) or a usual care group ({UCG}). Subjects completed visual analog scales, the {FACIT}-Fatigue Scale and the Short Form-36v2 after surgery and again 3 to 6 months after hospital discharge. {RESULTS}: Patients in the {IG} and {UCG} were comparable with regard to demographics, comorbidities, cancer type and staging, type of resection, preoperative fatigue and pain levels, adjuvant therapy, and baseline walking distance. Patients in the {IG} had significantly improved scores on the {FACIT}-Fatigue Scale at study completion, improved fatigue and pain scores, as well as overall physical functioning and mental health composite scores. At study completion, participants in the {IG} were walking twice as far and were significantly more likely to have continued walking or another form of exercise as compared with the {UCG}. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, 3 mutually exclusive symptom groupings were identified in the cohort. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis did not indicate an overall survival benefit for the {IG}. {CONCLUSIONS}: This is the first prospective, randomized controlled trial to report that participation in a home walking program confers a significant benefit in resected {PPC} patients with regard to fatigue levels, physical functioning, and health-related quality of life.},

	volume = {7},
	url = {http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12600445},
	abstract = {Although the mortality rate after pancreaticoduodenectomy has decreased, the morbidity rate remains high. Major morbidity is often managed with the aid of interventional radiologists. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cooperative roles of interventional radiologists and pancreatic surgeons in complex pancreatic surgery, specifically pancreaticoduodenectomy. Our pancreaticoduodenectomy database was reviewed for all patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2000. The interventional radiologic procedures for each patient were evaluated. A total of 1061 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. The overall mortality and morbidity rates were 2.3\% and 35\%, respectively. Five hundred ninety patients (56\%) had no interventional radiologic procedures, whereas 471 patients (44\%) had interventional radiologic procedures. Of those, 342 (32\%) had preoperative biliary drainage ({PBD}) and 129 (12\%) required postoperative interventional radiologic procedures. Percutaneous aspiration/catheter drainage was required in 84 patients for intra-abdominal abscess, biloma, or lymphocele, with 24 requiring two or more abscess drains. Thirty-nine patients underwent postoperative {PBD} for bile leaks due to anastomotic disruption, undrained biliary segments, or T-tube/bile stent dislodgment. Eighteen patients had hemobilia/gastrointestinal bleeding treated by angiography with embolization. The reoperation rate for the entire cohort of 1061 patients was 4.1\% (n = 43). Nineteen of the 129 patients (15\%) requiring postoperative radiologic intervention required reoperation. Although 4 of 18 patients who required embolization for bleeding subsequently required surgical intervention for the same reason, only 4 of 84 patients undergoing abscess drainage later required operation for anastomotic disruption or unsuccessful percutaneous drainage. As would be expected, the patients who required postoperative radiologic intervention (n = 129) had a higher incidence of postoperative complications including pancreatic fistula (20\% vs. 6\%, P {\textless} 0.01), bile leakage (22\% vs. 1\%, P {\textless} 0.01), and wound infection (16\% vs. 8\%, P {\textless} 0.01). With the complications in these 129 patients, the postoperative mortality rate was only 6.2\% compared to 1.7\% in patients who did not require radiologic intervention (n = 932, P {\textless} 0.01). The median postoperative length of stay was 15 days in those patients requiring postoperative radiologic intervention, 10 days in those not requiring intervention (P {\textless} 0.01; postoperative interventional radiology vs. no postoperative interventional radiology), and 29.5 days for patients needing reoperation. Interventional radiologists play a critical role in the management of some patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Although complications such as anastomotic leaks, abscess formation, and bleeding can result in increased mortality and a longer hospital stay, the skills of the interventional radiology team provide expert management of some life-threatening complications, thus avoiding reoperation, speeding recovery times, and minimizing morbidity.},

This study analyzed the possible prognostic factors of resected ductal adenocarcinoma through pancreaticoduodenectomy in a single institution. {METHODS}: Between Oct. 1994 and May. 2002, 81 patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Perioperative and pathologic factors were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analysis. {RESULTS}: The overall 5-year survival rate of the 81 patients was 10.8\% with median survival of 11.8 months. Ninety-six percent of the patients were in stage {IIa}, {IIb} or {III}. In univariate analysis, factors favoring survival were as follows: {CA}19-9 antigen{\textless}or=200 U/{mL} (p=0.0055), no preoperative biliary drainage (p=0.018), operation time{\textless}or=6.5 hr (p=0.009), R0 (curative) resection (p=0.0001), negative gross vascular invasion (p=0.0012), tumor size{\textless}or=3 cm (p=0.002), T lesion{\textless}or=T3 (p=0.0014), no tumor necrosis (p=0.0041), no duodenal invasion (p=0.0004) and postoperative chemoradiation therapy (p=0.0365).

	abstract = {Background: The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}) has been proposed as an indicator of systemic inflammatory response. Previous findings from small-scale studies revealed conflicting results about its independent prognostic significance with regard to different clinical end points in pancreatic cancer ({PC}) patients. Therefore, the aim of our study was the external validation of the prognostic significance of {NLR} in a large cohort of {PC} patients.
Methods: Data from 371 consecutive {PC} patients, treated between 2004 and 2010 at a single centre, were evaluated retrospectively. The whole cohort was stratified into two groups according to the treatment modality. Group 1 comprised 261 patients with inoperable {PC} at diagnosis and group 2 comprised 110 patients with surgically resected {PC}. Cancer-specific survival ({CSS}) was assessed using the Kaplan–Meier method. To evaluate the independent prognostic significance of the {NLR}, the modified Glasgow prognostic score ({mGPS}) and the platelet-lymphocyte ratio univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were applied.
Results: Multivariate analysis identified increased {NLR} as an independent prognostic factor for inoperable {PC} patients (hazard ratio ({HR})=2.53, confidence interval ({CI})=1.64–3.91, P{\textless}0.001) and surgically resected {PC} patients ({HR}=1.61, {CI}=1.02–2.53, P=0.039). In inoperable {PC} patients, the {mGPS} was associated with poor {CSS} only in univariate analysis ({HR}=1.44, {CI}=1.04–1.98).
Conclusion: Risk prediction for cancer-related end points using {NLR} does add independent prognostic information to other well-established prognostic factors in patients with {PC}, regardless of the undergoing therapeutic modality. Thus, the {NLR} should be considered for future individual risk assessment in patients with {PC}.},

	abstract = {Endoscopic biliary stenting is the most common method of treating obstructive jaundice. We present a new technique of biliary drainage using endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS}) and {EUS}-guided puncture of the common bile duct ({CBD}). A 56-year-old man with obstructive jaundice was referred for {EUS} and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ({ERCP}) because a computed tomography ({CT}) scan had shown a pancreatic mass in the head of the pancreas and a dilated {CBD}. The patient was enrolled in a preoperative chemoradiotherapy protocol and biliary stenting was required. Deep cannulation was not obtained even after a precut and the procedure was stopped. Using a therapeutic {EUS} scope ({FG} 38X Pentax), the {CBD} was punctured with a 5-F needle-knife under {EUS} guidance and a cholangiogram was obtained. A 0.35-inch guide wire was introduced into the {CBD}. The {EUS} scope was removed and a duodenoscope was introduced, allowing the placement through the duodenum of a 10-F plastic stent. The {CBD} was drained properly. No complication occurred.},

Risk factors include smoking, high body mass index ({BMI}), family history of pancreatic cancer, and long-standing diabetes; in contrast, allergies are associated with reduced risk. Little is known about associations between these factors and survival. We analyzed overall survival in relation to risk factors for 475 incident cases who took part in a hospital based case–control study. Analyses were conducted separately for those who did (160) and did not (315) undergo tumor resection. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to describe survival according to smoking, {BMI}, family history, diabetes, and presence of allergies. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for covariates. There was no association with survival based on smoking, family history, or history of diabetes in either group. Among patients with resection, those with allergies showed nonstatistically significant longer survival, a median of 33.1 months (95\% {CI}: 19.0–52.5) vs. 21.8 months (95\% {CI}: 18.0–33.1), p = 0.25. The adjusted hazard ratio ({HR}) was 0.72 (95\% {CI}: 0.43–1.23), p = 0.23. Among patients without resection, those with self-reported allergies survived significantly longer than those without allergies: 13.3 months (95\% {CI}: 10.6–16.9) compared to 10.4 months (95\% {CI}: 8.8–11.0), p = 0.04, with an adjusted {HR} of 0.68 (95\% {CI}: 0.49–0.95), p = 0.02.

It has been suggested that in patients with cirrhosis, O2 transfer might become diffusion-limited during exercise. This study examined pulmonary hemodynamics and mechanisms modulating gas exchange during exercise (60 to 70\% {VO}2max) in six patients (41 +/- 5 yr, mean +/- {SEM}) with cirrhosis but with normal lung function tests. At rest, {QT} was high (8.4 +/- 0.5 L/min), pulmonary vascular resistance ({PVR}) was low (0.61 +/- 0.17 mm Hg/L/min), and there was mild to moderate {VA}/Q mismatching ({LogSD} Q, 0.79 +/- 0.09; normal range, 0.3 to 0.6). However, hyperventilation ({PaCO}2, 29 +/- 2 mm Hg) and high {QT} (thus, high {PVO}2, 41 +/- 2 mm Hg) contributed to the maintenance of {PaO}2 within normal values (99 +/- 7 mm Hg). Exercise {VO}2 (1,278 +/- 122 ml/min) was normal relative to work load, but, contrary to that in normal subjects, {QT} was higher and {PVR} did not fall. During exercise, {PaO}2 showed a trend to decrease (to 90 +/- 5 mm Hg) and {PaCO}2 to rise (to 35 +/- 2 mm Hg), but the differences failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.07 each). {PVO}2 fell significantly with exercise (41 +/- 2 to 33 +/- 0.3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), but neither {AaPO}2 (15 +/- 7 to 21 +/- 6 mm Hg) nor {VA}/Q inequality ({LogSD} Q, 0.82 +/- 0.11) changed.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Patients with obstructive jaundice have various pathophysiological changes that affect the liver, kidney, heart, and the immune system. There is considerable controversy as to whether temporary relief of biliary obstruction prior to major definitive surgery (pre-operative biliary drainage) is of any benefit to the patient.
{OBJECTIVES}: To assess the benefits and harms of pre-operative biliary drainage versus no pre-operative biliary drainage (direct surgery) in patients with obstructive jaundice (irrespective of a benign or malignant cause).
{SEARCH} {METHODS}: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials ({CENTRAL}) in The Cochrane Library, {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, and Science Citation Index Expanded until February 2012.
{SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: We included all randomised clinical trials comparing biliary drainage followed by surgery versus direct surgery, performed for obstructive jaundice, irrespective of the sample size, language, and publication status.
{DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio ({RR}), rate ratio ({RaR}), or mean difference ({MD}) with 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) based on the available patient analyses. We assessed the risk of bias (systematic overestimation of benefit or systematic underestimation of harm) with components of the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We assessed the risk of play of chance (random errors) with trial sequential analysis.
{MAIN} {RESULTS}: We included six trials with 520 patients comparing pre-operative biliary drainage (265 patients) versus no pre-operative biliary drainage (255 patients). Four trials used percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and two trials used endoscopic sphincterotomy and stenting as the method of pre-operative biliary drainage. The risk of bias was high in all trials. The proportion of patients with malignant obstruction varied between 60\% and 100\%. There was no significant difference in mortality (40/265, weighted proportion 14.9\%) in the pre-operative biliary drainage group versus the direct surgery group (34/255, 13.3\%) ({RR} 1.12; 95\% {CI} 0.73 to 1.71; P = 0.60). The overall serious morbidity was higher in the pre-operative biliary drainage group (60 per 100 patients in the pre-operative biliary drainage group versus 26 per 100 patients in the direct surgery group) ({RaR} 1.66; 95\% {CI} 1.28 to 2.16; P = 0.0002). The proportion of patients who developed serious morbidity was significantly higher in the pre-operative biliary drainage group (75/102, 73.5\%) in the pre-operative biliary drainage group versus the direct surgery group (37/94, 37.4\%) (P {\textless} 0.001). Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay (2 trials, 271 patients; {MD} 4.87 days; 95\% {CI} -1.28 to 11.02; P = 0.12) between the two groups. Trial sequential analysis showed that for mortality only a small proportion of the required information size had been obtained. There seemed to be no significant differences in the subgroup of trials assessing percutaneous compared to endoscopic drainage.
{AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: There is currently not sufficient evidence to support or refute routine pre-operative biliary drainage for patients with obstructive jaundice. Pre-operative biliary drainage may increase the rate of serious adverse events. So, the safety of routine pre-operative biliary drainage has not been established. Pre-operative biliary drainage should not be used in patients undergoing surgery for obstructive jaundice outside randomised clinical trials.},

It is incomplete, however, since it dispenses clinical advice without regard for the fact that the patient--for whatever reason--might choose to reject that advice. Game theory provides a supplementary means to explicate optimal rational strategies in situations where the actual outcome depends on the choices of both the patient and the physician. To determine its potential clinical relevance, we used game theory to reassess a clinical problem which has been used as a textbook exemplar of decision analysis: Should patients with chronic liver failure undergo liver biopsy before being treated? Decision analysis prescribes a pure (deterministic) strategy: the physician should always perform a biopsy. In contrast, given the proper conditions, game theory mandates a mixed (probabilistic) strategy: the physician should (randomly) recommend biopsy to only some fraction of patients, and only some fraction of these should (randomly) accept this advice. Thus, whenever the patient is free to accept or reject the physician's advice, game theory provides a prescriptive decision-making model which is qualitatively and quantitatively different from decision analysis.},

{OBJECTIVE}: To test the hypothesis that adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine administered after complete resection of pancreatic cancer improves disease-free survival by 6 months or more.
{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PATIENTS}: Open, multicenter, randomized controlled phase 3 trial with stratification for resection, tumor, and node status. Conducted from July 1998 to December 2004 in the outpatient setting at 88 academic and community-based oncology centers in Germany and Austria. A total of 368 patients with gross complete (R0 or R1) resection of pancreatic cancer and no prior radiation or chemotherapy were enrolled into 2 groups.
{INTERVENTION}: Patients received adjuvant chemotherapy with 6 cycles of gemcitabine on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks (n = 179), or observation ([control] n = 175).
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Primary end point was disease-free survival, and secondary end points were overall survival, toxicity, and quality of life. Survival analysis was based on all eligible patients (intention-to-treat).
{RESULTS}: More than 80\% of patients had R0 resection. The median number of chemotherapy cycles in the gemcitabine group was 6 (range, 0-6). Grade 3 or 4 toxicities rarely occurred with no difference in quality of life (by Spitzer index) between groups. During median follow-up of 53 months, 133 patients (74\%) in the gemcitabine group and 161 patients (92\%) in the control group developed recurrent disease. Median disease-free survival was 13.4 months in the gemcitabine group (95\% confidence interval, 11.4-15.3) and 6.9 months in the control group (95\% confidence interval, 6.1-7.8; P{\textless}.001, log-rank). Estimated disease-free survival at 3 and 5 years was 23.5\% and 16.5\% in the gemcitabine group, and 7.5\% and 5.5\% in the control group, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the effect of gemcitabine on disease-free survival was significant in patients with either R0 or R1 resection. There was no difference in overall survival between the gemcitabine group (median, 22.1 months; 95\% confidence interval, 18.4-25.8; estimated survival, 34\% at 3 years and 22.5\% at 5 years) and the control group (median, 20.2 months; 95\% confidence interval, 17-23.4; estimated survival, 20.5\% at 3 years and 11.5\% at 5 years; P = .06, log-rank).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Postoperative gemcitabine significantly delayed the development of recurrent disease after complete resection of pancreatic cancer compared with observation alone. These results support the use of gemcitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy in resectable carcinoma of the pancreas.

Cytokines and acute-phase proteins were measured before administration of ibuprofen and again 3 days later, when protein  synthesis was measured using 15N-glycine. In patients with cancer, ibuprofen caused a significant reduction in the plasma concentration of all five acute-phase proteins studied. Although interleukin 6 levels were raised, they did not change following administration of ibuprofen. Unlike the situation in patients with cancer who did not receive ibuprofen, whole-body protein kinetics were similar to those of control subjects in patients with cancer who received ibuprofen. Whether or not ibuprofen had been administered, non-export hepatic protein synthesis rates were significantly lower in patients with than in those without cancer. These results suggest that short-term administration of ibuprofen can attenuate accelerated whole-body protein kinetics and the acute-phase response in patients with advanced cancer.},

The simple model was described by V(O2) peak = M(b) (or {FFM}(b)) exp(c {SR}-{PA}) exp(a + d age) epsilon (where M is body mass in kg; {FFM} is fat-free mass in kg; {SR}-{PA} is self-reported physical activity; epsilon is a multiplicative error term; and exp indicates natural antilogarithms). The full model was described by V(O2) peak = M(b) (or {FFM}(b)) exp(c {SR}-{PA}) exp(a + d age) + e (epsilon), where e is a permitted Y-intercept term. The M exponent obtained from simple allometry was 0.65 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}), 0.59-0.71], suggestive of a curvilinear relationship constrained to pass through the origin. This "zero Y-intercept" assumption was examined via the full allometric model, which revealed an M exponent of 1.00 (95\% {CI}, 0.7-1.31), together with a positive Y-intercept term (e) of 1.13 (95\% {CI}, 0.54-1.73). The {FFM} exponents were not significantly different from unity in either the simple or full allometric models. It appears that the curvilinearity of the simple allometric model (using total M) is fictitious and is due to the inappropriate forcing of the regression line through the origin. Utilizing {FFM} as the body-size variable revealed a linear relationship between body size and V(O2) peak, irrespective of model choice. We conclude that the population mass exponent for V(O2) peak is close to unity.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: To date, only limited data are available regarding the routine surgical management of patients with exocrine pancreatic cancer ({PC}) in German community and university hospitals. {METHODS}: With the use of a standardized questionnaire, a national survey on surgical and oncological treatment concepts for {PC} in Germany was conducted on behalf of the Chirurgische Arbeitsgemeinschaft Onkologie and Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie. The surgical part of that questionnaire contained 25 questions on criteria regarding resectability, surgical techniques, perioperative patient management, and palliative surgical procedures in advanced {PC}. Data were collected centrally and analyzed using the {SPSS}((R)) software. Additionally, predefined subgroup analyses, classifying the results by the professional site of the responding physician and the local annual number of treated patients, were carried out. {RESULTS}: One-hundred and two questionnaires on the surgical survey section were returned. For the majority of the survey respondents, arterial infiltration is the most important criterion for non-resectability of {PC} (common hepatic artery, 69.9\%; superior mesenteric artery, 85.3\%; celiac trunk, 86.3\%), whereas only 17.6\% would define non-resectability based on portal vein infiltration; 69.9\% consider extrapancreatic tumor manifestations as a criterion of surgical non-resectability. Of the survey participants, 53.9\% perform a biliary drainage in case of preoperative cholestasis, whereas 43.1\% reject this preoperative endoscopic-interventional approach. For cancers of the pancreatic head, 24.5\% of surgical units recommend a classical Kausch-Whipple procedure, 52.9\% prefer the pylorus-preserving partial pancreatoduodenectomy, and 20.6\% use both procedures; 74.5\% routinely perform a standard lymphadenectomy, whereas 16.7\% prefer an extended procedure. A radical pancreatic resection would be performed by 63.7\% of survey respondents also if a single liver metastasis would be found intraoperatively. {CONCLUSION}: Surgical treatment of {PC} in Germany is heterogeneous; future efforts to implement an evidence-based and standardized surgical management will be necessary.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The effects of preoperative versus postoperative fluorouracil (5-{FU})-based chemotherapy and irradiation on treatment toxicity, duration of treatment, tumor recurrence, and survival were compared in patients who underwent potentially curative therapy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head during a 5-year period.
{METHODS}: From July 1990 to July 1995, 142 patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head deemed resectable on the basis of radiographic images were treated with curative intent using a multimodality approach involving either preoperative or postoperative chemoradiation. Patients with biopsy confirmation of adenocarcinoma and a low-density mass in the pancreatic head identified by computed tomography ({CT}) received preoperative chemoradiation. Patients without a mass on {CT} or in whom the preoperative biopsy was negative underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with planned postoperative chemoradiation. Protocol-based preoperative chemoradiation consisted of external-beam irradiation at a dose of 50.4 Gy (standard fractionation; 1.8 Gy/d, 5 d/wk) or 30 Gy (rapid fractionation; 3 Gy/d, 5 d/wk) combined with continuous infusion 5-{FU} (300 mg/m2/d, 5 d/wk). Postoperative chemoradiation combined 50.4 Gy of external-beam irradiation (standard fractionation) with continuous-infusion 5-{FU}.
{RESULTS}: No patient who received preoperative chemoradiation experienced a delay in surgery because of chemoradiation toxicity, but six of 25 eligible patients (24\%) did not receive postoperative chemoradiation because of delayed recovery after pancreaticoduodenectomy. No significant differences in toxicities from chemoradiation were observed between groups. Patients treated with rapid-fractionation preoperative chemoradiation had a significantly (P {\textless} .01) shorter duration of treatment (median, 62.5 days) compared with patients who received postoperative chemoradiation (median, 98.5 days) or standard-fractionation preoperative chemoradiation (median, 91.0 days). At a median followup of 19 months, no significant differences in survival were observed between treatment groups. No patient who received preoperative chemoradiation and pancreaticoduodenectomy experienced a local recurrence; peritoneal (regional) recurrence occurred in 10\% of these patients. Local or regional recurrence occurred in 21\% of patients who received pancreaticoduodenectomy and postoperative chemoradiation.
{CONCLUSION}: Delivery of preoperative and postoperative chemoradiation in patients who underwent potentially curative pancreaticoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head resulted in similar treatment toxicity, patterns of tumor recurrence, and survival. Rapid-fractionation preoperative chemoradiation ensured the delivery of all components of therapy to all eligible patients with a significantly shorter duration of treatment than with standard-fractionation chemoradiation given either before or after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Prolonged recovery after pancreaticoduodenectomy prevents the delivery of postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation in up to one fourth of eligible patients.},

	abstract = {Background
Although operative resection represents the only hope for cure in pancreatic cancer, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, in some patients disease progression occurs very early postoperatively and no tangible benefit is seen from the operation. Identification of preoperative predictors of death within the first year of surgery could help in the counseling of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
Methods
We studied retrospectively patients who underwent resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma from 2002 to 2012. We calculated the age-adjusted Charlson Age Comorbidity Index ({CACI}) and used logistic regression models to determine predictors of mortality within 1 year of surgery. Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were developed to determine hazard ratios on survival.
Results
Surgery with curative intent was performed in 497 patients; 136 (27\%) died within the first year. A {CACI} score of \&gt;4 was predictive of increased duration of stay (P \&lt; .001), postoperative complications (P = .042), and mortality within 1 year of pancreatic resection (P \&lt; .001). A {CACI} score of ≥6 increased 3-fold the odds of death within the first year.
Conclusion
{CACI} is useful to predict outcome after pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer. Patients with a high {CACI} score have a \&lt;50\% likelihood of being alive 1 year postoperatively. This information should be used when considering the appropriateness of pancreatic resection in patients with multiple comorbidities.},

	volume = {77},
	issn = {0022-4790},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {OBJECTIVES}: The incidence of pancreatic cancer is increasing, and an increasing proportion of these patients is older than 65 years. The benefits of resection in the geriatric population, in whom major comorbidity is more likely, are poorly defined. The authors sought to determine the relative benefits of resection of cancer of the head of the pancreas in different age groups, with particular emphasis on the geriatric population.
{METHODS}: Between 1983 and 1995, 273 patients presented to the University of Miami for evaluation of noncystic epithelial cancer of the head of the pancreas. Resection was performed in 104 patients, and these patients are the subject of this retrospective review. Mean length of follow-up for surviving patients was 37 +/- 24 months. Outcomes were compared in patients {\textless} 65 years old (group 1, n = 38), 65-74 years old (group 2, n = 47), and {\textgreater} 74 years old (group 3, n = 19).
{RESULTS}: Total pancreatectomy was performed in 12 patients and pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in 92 patients. The overall complication rate was similar in all groups, but major morbidity was highest in group 3 (P = 0.05). Median survival for patients in group 2 was 25.1 months. Survival was significantly shorter in patients from groups 1 and 3 (median survivals 12.4 months and 11.4 months, respectively; P = 0.02). Following control for Hispanic ethnicity, which was also a significant prognostic factor on univariate analysis, only the oldest age group had a significantly shorter survival than the other two groups. Age {\textgreater} 74 years and Hispanic ethnicity remained significant after multivariate analysis.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Long-term survival after resection is truncated in older patients. This finding and the observation that the major complication rate is higher in the older subgroup emphasize the need to evaluate critically whether older patients should be submitted to radical resection.},

Forty-three percent of deaths were attributed to poor cardiopulmonary function, as detected preoperatively. There were no deaths related to cardiopulmonary complications in any patient deemed fit for major abdominal surgery and ward management, as determined by {CPX} testing. {CONCLUSIONS}: In elderly patients undergoing major intra-abdominal surgery, the {AT}, as determined by {CPX} testing, is an excellent predictor of mortality from cardiopulmonary causes in the postoperative period.

	abstract = {It is estimated that by 2050, there will be a 300\% increase in the elderly population ({\textgreater} or =65 years) and a corresponding increase in elderly patients presenting for surgical evaluation. Surgical decision-making in this population can be difficult because outcomes in the elderly are poorly defined. We reviewed 2698 consecutive pancreaticoduodenectomies ({PDs}) at our institution over a 35-year period (April 1970 through March 2005), with the last 1000 resections being done in the last 4 years. Data collected included surgical indication, mortality (defined as 30-day or in-hospital mortality), complications, and survival. Patients were divided by age into three groups ({\textless}80, 80-89, and {\textgreater} or =90 years) and evaluated using multiple logistic regression. Two hundred seven patients {\textgreater} or =80 years old underwent a {PD} (7.7\% of 2698). Patients 80-89 years of age had a mortality rate of 4.1\% (8 of 197) and a complication rate of 52.8\% (99 of 197), whereas patients {\textless} or =79 years of age had a mortality of 1.7\% and a complication rate of 41.6\% (P {\textless} 0.05). There were no perioperative deaths among the 10 patients {\textgreater} or =90 years of age, and their complication rate was 50\% (5 of 10). One-year survival for patients 80-89 years of age was 59.1\%, and that for patients {\textgreater} or =90 years was 60\%. Age was not an independent risk factor for perioperative mortality and morbidity following {PD} after adjusting for preoperative comorbidities. We demonstrate that {PD} can be safely performed in patients over 80 years of age and conclude that age alone should not be a contraindication to pancreatic resection. The advent of improved surgical outcomes and an aging population will likely result in a significant increase in the number of {PDs} performed in the next few decades.},

Applying his training in mathematics to the physical and psychological dimensions of individuals, he identified the 'average man' as characterised by the mean values of measured variables that follow a normal distribution. He believed that comparing the features of individuals against this average would allow scientists to better explore the processes that determine normal and abnormal qualities. Quetelet's methods influenced many, among them Florence Nightingale, and his simple measure for classifying a person's weight, dividing it by the square of their height, is widely known as the body mass index. First published in French in 1835 and reissued here in the 1842 English translation, this is his most influential work and includes a new preface that succinctly states his aim to be 'the analysis of normal man through his actions and of intellectual man through his productions'.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To investigate the effects of surgically induced weight loss on exercise capacity in patients with morbid obesity ({MO}).
{RESEARCH} {METHODS} {AND} {PROCEDURES}: A prospective 1-year follow-up study was carried out, with patients being their own controls. A symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise stress test was performed in 31 {MO} patients ({BMI} {\textgreater} 40 kg/m2) before and 1 year after undergoing bariatric surgery.
{RESULTS}: At 1 year after surgery, weight was reduced from 146 +/- 33 to 95 +/- 19 kg (p {\textless} 0.001), and {BMI} went from 51 +/- 4 to 33 +/- 6 kg/m2 (p {\textless} 0.001). After weight loss, obese patients performed each workload with lower oxygen consumption, heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, and ventilatory volume (p {\textless} 0.001). This reduced energy expenditure allowed them to increase the duration of their effort test from 13.8 +/- 3.8 to 21 +/- 4.2 minutes (p {\textless} 0.001). Upon finishing the exercise, {MO} patients before surgery were able to reach only 83\% of their age-predicted maximal heart rate, and their respiratory exchange ratio was 0.87 +/- 0.06. After weight loss, those values were 90\% and 1 +/- 0.08, respectively (p {\textless} 0.01). When we compared the peak O2 pulse corrected by fat free mass before and after surgery, no significant differences between the groups were found.
{DISCUSSION}: After surgically induced weight loss, {MO} patients markedly improved their exercise capacity. This is due to the fact that they were able to perform the external work with lower energy expenditure and also to increase cardiovascular stress, optimizing the use of cardiac reserve. There were no differences in cardiac function before and after surgery.},

The degree of suppression in lymphocyte proliferation was found to be dependent on the duration of hemorrhage. Mitogen-induced proliferation of lymphocytes was significantly reduced as early as 30 min after hemorrhage and became more depressed at 2.0 hr after hemorrhage.

Patients were evaluated by cardiopulmonary exercise test with blood sampling for haemoglobin and plasma protein measurements at rest and peak. During exercise, an isolated increase of haemoglobin suggested spleen contraction while a parallel increase of haemoglobin and proteins suggested fluid filtration through capillary wall. Groups were homogeneous for age and gender. Peak oxygen consumption ({VO}2) was 22.5 +/- 4.4 ml/min/kg (51 +/- 14\%) and 24.3 +/- 7.0 (53 +/- 12\%) in groups A and B respectively [not significant ({NS})].

In vivo cumulative pressor responses (Rmax) to intravenous and intraarterial infusions of norepinephrine and angiotensin {II} and to intravenous infusion of angiotensin I were studied pre- and postoperatively in chronic bile duct-ligated dogs and compared to sham-operated dogs. Preoperatively, the pressor responses to the cumulative infusion of six doses of vasoactive substances in the pre-sham operated and pre-chronic bile duct-ligated dogs were not significantly different. Postoperatively, in the sham-operated dogs, there was no significant change in systemic blood pressure at 1 and 3 weeks, and only in isolated instances were significantly different pressor responses found compared to the preoperative result. In chronic bile duct-ligated dogs, the mean systemic blood pressure fell significantly from 117.2 +/- 3.1 to 107.2 +/- 3.0 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) at 1 week and remained significantly lower at 3 weeks [109.7 +/- 2.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.05)].

In contrast, the Rmax to both intravenous and intraarterial angiotensin {II} infusions were significantly depressed at both 1 and 3 weeks. Similarly, the response to intravenous angiotensin I was significantly depressed. Cardiac output rose moderately in two sham-operated dogs from an average of 3.1 to 3.5 liters per min by 3 weeks associated with a decrease of 14.8\% in peripheral vascular resistance.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 250 {WORDS})},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Emergency abdominal surgery carries a high risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Goal directed therapy has been advocated to improve outcome in high-risk surgery. The aim of the present pilot study was to examine the effect of goal directed therapy using fluid alone on postoperative renal function and organ failure score in patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. {METHODS}: This prospective randomised pilot study included patients over  the age of 50 undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. In the intervention group pulse pressure variation measurements were used to guide fluid boluses of 6\% Hydroxyethylstarch 130/0.4. The control group received standard care. Serum urea, creatinine and cystatin C levels were measured prior to and at the end of surgery and postoperatively on day 1, day 3 and day 5. {RESULTS}: Thirty patients were recruited. One patient died prior to surgery and was excluded from the analysis.  The intervention group received a median of 750 ml of hydroxyethylstarch. The peak values of postoperative urea were 6.9 (2.7-31.8) vs. 6.4 (3.5-11.5)mmol/l (p=0.425), creatinine 100 (60-300) vs. 85 (65-150) micromol/l (p=0.085) and cystatin C 1.09 (0.66-4.94) vs. 1.01 (0.33-2.29)mg/dl (p=0.352) in the control and intervention group, respectively. {CONCLUSIONS}: In the present pilot study replacing the identified fluid deficit was not associated with a change in renal  function. These results do not preclude that goal directed therapy using fluid alone may have an effect on renal function but they would suggest that the effect size of fluid optimisation alone on renal function is small.},

	abstract = {Determinants of cancer progression and survival are multifactorial and host responses are increasingly appreciated to have a major role. Indeed, the development and maintenance of a systemic inflammatory response has been consistently observed to confer poorer outcome, in both early and advanced stage disease. For patients, cancer-associated symptoms are of particular importance resulting in a marked impact on day-to-day quality of life and are also associated with poorer outcome. These symptoms are now recognised to cluster with one another with anorexia, weight loss and physical function forming a recognised cluster whereas fatigue, pain and depression forming another. Importantly, it has become apparent that these symptom clusters are associated with presence of a systemic inflammatory response in the patient with cancer. Given the understanding of the above, there is now a need to intervene to moderate systemic inflammatory responses, where present. In this context the rationale for therapeutic intervention using nonselective anti-inflammatory agents is clear and compelling and likely to become a part of routine clinical practice in the near future. The published literature on therapeutic intervention using anti-inflammatory agents for cancer-associated symptoms was reviewed. There are important parallels with the development of useful treatments for the systemic inflammatory response in patients with rheumatological disease and cardiovascular disease.},

However, whether albumin synthesis is suppressed in hypoalbuminemic cancer patients with evidence of an ongoing acute-phase response  is unknown. {METHODS}: Albumin synthesis rates were determined in six healthy controls and in six weight-losing pancreatic cancer patients with an ongoing {APPR} using a flooding dose technique with [2H5]-phenylalanine. The presence of an {APPR} was defined as a serum C-reactive protein concentration {\textgreater}10 mg/L. Serum cytokines ({TNF}, {IL}-6) and soluble {TNF} receptors ({sTNF}-R 55 and 75), along with serum cortisol and insulin, were also measured in both groups. {RESULTS}: Cancer patients had reduced serum albumin (median 32 [range, 23-36] vs. 42 g/L [40-45]; p {\textless} 0.01) and increased serum C-reactive protein concentrations (72 [23-126] vs. {\textless}5 mg/L; p {\textless} 0.01) when compared with controls. {TNF} was not detected in either group. {sTNF}-R 55 levels were significantly elevated in the cancer patients (3.8 [1.9-8.1] vs. 1.2 pg/{mL} [0.9-2.2]; p {\textless} 0.01). Circulating {IL}-6, insulin, and cortisol concentrations were not significantly different between the groups. The intravascular albumin mass was lower (88 [56-93] vs. 133 g [105-177]; p {\textless} 0.01),  but the intravascular albumin fractional synthetic rate was higher (13.9 [13.5-18.5] vs. 10.3\%/d [71-11.3]; p {\textless} 0.01) in the cancer patients compared with the controls. The total intravascular albumin synthetic rate was, however, similar between the two groups (12.7 [7.7-15.7] vs. 11.7 g/d [8.5-18.7]; p {NS}). {CONCLUSIONS}: In weight-losing pancreatic cancer patients with evidence of an ongoing {APPR}, hypoalbuminemia is not caused by a decreased rate of albumin synthesis.},

	abstract = {Objective



* To determine the relationship of preoperatively measured cardiorespiratory function, to the development of postoperative complications and length of hospital stay ({LOS}) in a cohort of patients undergoing radical cystectomy ({RC}), as {RC} and conduit formation is curative but is associated with significant postoperative morbidity and mortality.



Patients and Methods



* Consecutive patients planned to have {RC} underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) to a standardised protocol.

* The results of the {CPET} were ‘blinded’ from the clinicians involved in the care of the patients.

* Patients were prospectively monitored for the primary outcome of postoperative complications, as defined by a validated classification (Clavien-Dindo).

* Secondary outcome included {LOS} and mortality.



Results



* In all, 82 patients underwent {CPET} before {RC}. Eight patients did not subsequently undergo {RC} and a further five did not exercise sufficiently to allow for appropriate determination of the cardiopulmonary variables of interest.

* There was a significant difference in {LOS} between those patients who had a major perioperative complication (Clavien score {\textgreater} 3) and those that did not (16 vs 30 days; P {\textless} 0.001; hazard ratio [{HR}] 3.6, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 2.1–6.3).

* The anaerobic threshold ({AT}) remained as the only significant independent predictor variable for the presence or absence of major postoperative complications (odds ratio 0.74, 95\% {CI} 0.57–0.97; P = 0.03).

* When the optimal predictive value of {AT} of 12 {mL}/min/kg was used as a fitness marker, there was a significant relationship between fitness and {LOS} (median {LOS}: ‘unfit’ 22 days vs ‘fit’ 16 days; {HR} 0.47, 95\% {CI} 0.28–0.80; P = 0.006)



Conclusion



* Impaired preoperative cardiopulmonary reserve was related to major morbidity, prolonged {LOS} and increased use of critical care resource after {RC}.

* This has important health and economic implications for risk assessment, rationalisation of postoperative resource and the potential for therapeutic preoperative intervention with exercise therapy.},

{RESULTS}: Five hundred and sixty-nine patients were included; 47\% were aged ≥ 65 years old, 36\% had comorbidity ({CCI}{\textgreater}0). In multivariate analysis, neither age (p=0.22) nor comorbidity (p=0.21) was associated with overall survival. The baseline presence of better {PS} and lower pain intensity scores was associated with better overall survival (p {\textless} 0.0001 and p=0.01, respectively). An improvement in survival with the addition of erlotinib therapy was seen in patients age {\textless} 65 (adjusted hazard ratio ({HR}) 0.73, p=0.01) or in the presence of comorbidity (adjusted {HR} 0.72, p=0.03). However, neither age nor {CCI} score was predictive of erlotinib benefit after test for interaction.

However, the interrelationships of biochemical and cellular components of the systemic inflammatory response and the local inflammatory response are poorly understood.  {METHODS}: Retrospective study of 287 patients who underwent surgery between 1997 and 2004. Data were collected from routine preoperative blood tests. Routine pathology specimens were scored according to Jass and Klintrup criteria for peritumoral infiltrate. {RESULTS}: Increased Dukes stage was associated with less peritumoral infiltrate (Jass criteria: P {\textless} 0.001, Klintrup criteria: P {\textless} 0.01). Increased modified {GPS} ({mGPS}) was associated with increased circulating white cell (P {\textless} 0.01) and neutrophil (P {\textless} 0.01) counts and low lymphocyte counts (P {\textless} 0.01). Increased circulating white cell count was associated with increased neutrophil count (P {\textless} 0.001) and low-grade peritumoral infiltrate (P {\textless} 0.05, Klintrup criteria).

The patients were examined before and after a training period of 4-5 weeks and 10-12 weeks, respectively. The calculated oxygen consumption increased by 19\% and 29\%, and the estimated work load capacity improved. No change occurred in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatases, gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase, serum bilirubin, or prealbumin, whereas creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase increased significantly. The clinical condition did not worsen in any patient, and most of the patients felt that their physical performance capacity had improved. We conclude that long-term regular physical training is well tolerated by patients with chronic active hepatitis in clinical remission and that training leads to improvement in the oxygen consumption and the estimated work load capacity in such patients.},

	abstract = {Objective
To analyze prognostic factors influencing pancreatic cancer survival following curative resection, using prospectively collected, population-based data.

Summary Background Data
Several studies have analyzed the determinants of long-term survival in postresection pancreatic cancer patients, but the majority of these have been single-institutional chart reviews yielding inconsistent results.

Methods
This retrospective cohort study examined 396 Medicare-eligible patients over age 65 who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and who underwent surgical resection with curative intent while residing in one of the 11 Survival, Epidemiology, and End Results ({SEER}) registries between January 1991 and December 1996. Linked Medicare data provided information on treatment and comorbidity, while linked census tract data supplied sociodemographic characteristics.

Results
Median survival for the overall study population was 17.6 months, with 1- and 3-year survival rates of 60.1\% and 34.3\%, respectively. Survival appears to be gradually improving over time, concomitant with a rise in the proportion of patients undergoing surgery in teaching centers. Prognostic variables significantly diminishing survival on univariate analysis included African American race, treatment not in a teaching hospital, lack of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy, as well as histopathologic factors that included tumor size larger than 2 cm in diameter, moderate to poor histologic grade, and positive lymph node metastases. Higher socioeconomic status was associated both with an increased likelihood of receiving adjuvant therapy and improved overall survival. Multivariate analyses indicated the strongest predictors of survival were adjuvant combined chemoradiotherapy, small tumors ({\textless}2 cm in diameter), negative lymph nodes, well-differentiated histology, undergoing surgery in a teaching hospital, and high socioeconomic status.

Conclusions
Although biologic characteristics remain important predictors of survival for patients with resected pancreatic cancer, the most powerful determinant is postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. An interesting finding that warrants further investigation is the effect of socioeconomic status on both the likelihood of receiving adjuvant treatment and subsequent survival, indicating a possible relationship between the quality of care delivered and outcomes.},

Biochemical parameters, such as C-reactive protein and albumin (combined to form the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score, {mGPS}), alkaline phosphatase (Alk phos), gamma-glutamyl transferase ({GGT}) and serum calcium have been reported to be associated with cancer and non-cancer mortality. Therefore, to definitively examine the interrelationships between the above biochemical parameters, the {mGPS} and the presence of cancer, the Glasgow Inflammation Outcome Study was undertaken. The aim of this initial study was to examine the effect of  cancer on markers of systemic inflammation induced by the liver ({mGPS}) and on levels of routine biochemical parameters. {METHODS}: Patients (n=223 303) who had a single incidental sample taken for C-reactive protein, albumin, calcium and serum liver function tests where available, between 2000 and 2008 were studied.

	abstract = {Background:
Patients who undergo major surgery for cancer are at high risk of postoperative infection. Postoperative immunosuppression may be due to dysregulation of cytokine production. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between changes in serum proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations and postoperative septic complications after major surgery.
Methods:
Serial blood samples were collected from 30 consecutive patients for determination of serum cytokine levels. Healthy volunteers were used as the control group.
Results:
Eleven patients developed no complications (group 1), 14 developed sepsis or severe sepsis (group 2), and five developed septic shock (group 3). On day 1 the patients in groups 2 and 3 had significantly higher levels of interleukin ({IL}) 6 than those in group 1. {IL}-6 levels remained high until day 5. Tumour necrosis factor ({TNF}), {IL}-1, interferon ({IFN}) γ and {IL}-12 levels were not affected by surgical trauma or by the occurrence of septic complications. After operation the circulating {IL}-1 receptor antagonist ({IL}-1ra) concentration was increased in all groups, but patients in group 3 had significantly higher levels of {IL}-1ra than those in group 1. {IL}-1ra levels correlated with {IL}-6 levels. The pattern of {IL}-10 levels was similar to that of {IL}-1ra levels.
Conclusion:
Serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines ({TNF}, {IL}-1, {IFN}-γ and {IL}-12) were not affected by operation or the occurrence of septic complications. The postoperative increase in {IL}-6 concentration was associated with septic morbidity, while raised {IL}-1ra concentration was associated with postoperative septic shock. © 2002 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd},

{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS}: Patient characteristics and preoperative radiographic findings and their association with postoperative complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy were analyzed for 356 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent resection between 2000 and 2005.
{RESULTS}: Postoperative complications developed in 135 patients (38\%). The most common complications were pancreatic fistula/abscess (15\%), wound infection (14\%), and delayed gastric emptying (4\%). On multivariate analysis, the only preoperative radiographic factors associated with having any postoperative complication were the absence of pancreatic atrophy and the extent of central obesity determined by the thickness of retrorenal visceral fat ({VF}). Complications occurred in 51\% of patients with {VF} {\textgreater} or = 2 cm, compared to 31\% of patients with {VF} {\textless} 2 cm, p {\textless} 0.001. Postoperatively, pancreatic fistula developed in 24\% of patients with {VF} {\textgreater} or = 2 cm and in only 10\% of patients with {VF} {\textless} 2 cm, p = 0.01.

C-reactive protein ({CRP}) is an acute phase protein released in inflammatory states. To analyze the usefulness of {CRP} as a marker of infection in surgical pediatric patients, we analyzed its kinetics in these patients in comparison with usual markers, such temperature, leukocytes, or fibrinogen.
{METHODS}: One hundred three pediatric patients undergoing major surgery were enrolled consecutively in this observational study. C-reactive protein, leukocytes, neutrophils, platelets, fibrinogen, glycemia, and temperature were determined daily after surgery. Patients were classified as infected or not infected. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, efficiency, precocity, positive likelihood ratio, and number of subjects to be treated were calculated.
{RESULTS}: Peak in {CRP} was detected at 48 ± 24 hours. C-reactive protein was higher in the infected group from the first day, with significant differences between groups from the second day. Best cutoff for detecting infection was increases in {CRP} of 11 mg/{dL} in 48 hours, with a sensitivity of 87\%, specificity of 89\%, precocity of 1.7 days (0.82-2.54), number of subjects to be treated of 1.7 (1.4-2.6), and positive likelihood ratio of 7.9. Application of other markers alone or in combination did not surpass the sensitivity, specificity, or precocity for increases in {CRP} of 11 mg/{dL} in 48 hours.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Increases of {CRP} constitute an easy and cheap prognostic alert system and may be used to establish strategies aimed to detect infection in surgical pediatric patients.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: The obesity epidemic coupled with epidemiologic evidence of the link between pancreatic cancer and obesity has raised the interest in the impact of body mass index ({BMI}) on outcomes for resected pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS}: All patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy ({PD}) for pancreatic adenocarcinoma from 1981 to 2007 were categorized into four groups according to their {BMI} ({\textless}25, 25 to {\textless}30, 30 to {\textless}35, and ≥35). Associations of these {BMI} groups with perioperative (operating time, blood loss, complications, in-hospital mortality), pathologic (tumor diameter, tumor stage, differentiation, lymph node status, R0 status) features and long-term patient outcome were evaluated using Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards regression. A second set of analyses were performed by dichotomizing patients into morbidly obese ({BMI} ≥ 35) in comparison to the rest.
{RESULTS}: Of the 586 consecutive patients studied, there were 232 (39.6\%) with {BMI} {\textless}25, 232 (39.6\%) with {BMI} 25 to {\textless}30, 89 (15.2\%) with {BMI} 30 to {\textless}35, and 33 (5.6\%) with {BMI} ≥ 35. Operating time (P = 0.003) and intraoperative blood loss (P {\textless} 0.001) increased with {BMI}, although none of the remaining perioperative features differed significantly among the {BMI} groups. Similarly, there were no significant associations between {BMI} group and the pathological features studied, particularly lymph node status (P= 0.98). {BMI} was not associated with lymph node status even after adjusting for tumor diameter. All analyses were repeated for the morbidly obese. Cox regression did not demonstrate an impact of {BMI} or morbid obesity on overall or disease-free survival.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {BMI} (and morbid obesity) does not appear to influence long-term outcomes for patients undergoing {PD}. Surgeons should be vigilant of the greater risk of perioperative blood loss with increasing {BMI}.},

	abstract = {Since extrahepatic bile duct cancer is difficult to diagnose and to cure, a safe and radical surgical strategy is needed. In this review, the modes of infiltration and spread of extrahepatic bile duct cancer and surgical strategy are discussed. Extended hemihepatectomy, with or without pancreatoduodenectomy ({PD}), plus extrahepatic bile duct resection and regional lymphadenectomy has recently been recognized as the standard curative treatment for hilar bile duct cancer. On the other hand, {PD} is the choice of treatment for middle and distal bile duct cancer. Major hepatectomy concomitant with {PD} (hepatopancreatoduodenectomy) has been applied to selected patients with widespread tumors. Preoperative biliary drainage ({BD}) followed by portal vein embolization ({PVE}) enables major hepatectomy in patients with hilar bile duct cancer without mortality. {BD} should be performed considering the surgical procedure, especially, in patients with separated intrahepatic bile ducts caused by hilar bile duct cancer. Right or left trisectoriectomy are indicated according to the tumor spread and biliary anatomy. As a result, extended radical resection offers a chance for cure of hilar bile duct cancer with improved resectability, curability, and a 5-year survival rate of 40\%. A 5-year survival rate has ranged from 24\% to 39\% after {PD} for middle and distal bile duct cancer.},

	abstract = {The incidence of the metabolic syndrome has taken epidemic proportions in the past decades, contributing to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The metabolic syndrome can be defined as a cluster of cardiovascular disease risk factors including visceral obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, increased blood pressure, and hypercoagulability. The farnesoid X receptor ({FXR}) belongs to the superfamily of ligand-activated nuclear receptor transcription factors. {FXR} is activated by bile acids, and {FXR}-deficient ({FXR}−/−) mice display elevated serum levels of triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, demonstrating a critical role of {FXR} in lipid metabolism. In an opposite manner, activation of {FXR} by bile acids ({BAs}) or nonsteroidal synthetic {FXR} agonists lowers plasma triglycerides by a mechanism that may involve the repression of hepatic {SREBP}-1c expression and/or the modulation of glucose-induced lipogenic genes. A cross-talk between {BA} and glucose metabolism was recently identified, implicating both {FXR}-dependent and {FXR}-independent pathways. The first indication for a potential role of {FXR} in diabetes came from the observation that hepatic {FXR} expression is reduced in animal models of diabetes. While {FXR}−/− mice display both impaired glucose tolerance and decreased insulin sensitivity, activation of {FXR} improves hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in vivo in diabetic mice. Finally, a recent report also indicates that {BA} may regulate energy expenditure in a {FXR}-independent manner in mice, via activation of the G protein-coupled receptor {TGR}5. Taken together, these findings suggest that modulation of {FXR} activity and {BA} metabolism may open new attractive pharmacological approaches for the treatment of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.},

We performed symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing in 19 cirrhotics without confounding variables (cardiopulmonary disease, beta blockade, anemia, smoking). Twelve concurrently exercised patients without cirrhosis and with normal resting pulmonary function were controls. Oxygen consumption ({VO}2) at peak exercise, at anaerobic threshold ({VO}2-{AT}), work rate ({WR}), and heart rate ({HR}) were measured. Cirrhotics had significantly lower peak {WR} (73+/-4 vs 107+/-7\% predicted, p {\textless} 0.001), {VO}2 (72+/-4 vs 98+/-5\% predicted, P {\textless} 0.001), {VO}2-{AT} (53+/-4 vs 71+/-5\% predicted peak {VO}2, P {\textless} 0.01), {HR} (83+/-2 vs 91+/-2\% predicted, P {\textless} 0.01) and were more likely to have chronotropic dysfunction (peak {HR} {\textless} 85\% predicted).

	doi = {10.1016/j.ejso.2014.03.021},
	abstract = {{AbstractBackground}
Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ({NACRT}) followed by surgery for resectable locally advanced rectal cancer improves outcome compared with surgery alone. Our primary hypothesis was that {NACRT} impairs objectively-measured physical fitness. We also wished to explore the relationship between fitness and postoperative outcome.
Method
In an observational study, we prospectively studied 27 consecutive patients, of whom 25 undertook cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) 2 weeks before and 7 weeks after standardized {NACRT}, then underwent surgery. In-hospital post-operative morbidity and mortality were recorded. Patients were followed up to 1 year for mortality. Data was analysed blind to clinical details. Receiver-operating characteristic ({ROC}) analysis defined the predictive value of {CPET} for in-hospital morbidity at day 5.
Results
Oxygen uptake ( V ˙ O 2 in ml kg−1 min−1) at estimated lactate threshold ( θ ˆ L ) and at peak exercise ( V ˙ O 2 at peak in ml kg−1 min−1) both significantly decreased post-{NACRT}: V ˙ O 2 at θ ˆ L 12.1 (pre-{NACRT}) vs. 10.6 (post-{NACRT}), p \&lt; 0.001 (95\%{CI} −1.7, −1.2); V ˙ O 2 at peak 18.1 vs. 16.7, p \&lt; 0.001 (95\%{CI} −3.1, −1.0). Optimal V ˙ O 2 at θ ˆ L and peak pre-{NACRT} for predicting postoperative morbidity were 12.0 and 18.1 ( V ˙ O 2 at θ ˆ L – {AUC} = 0.71, 77\% sensitive and 75\% specific; V ˙ O 2 at peak – {AUC} = 0.75, 78\% sensitive and 76\% specific). Optimal V ˙ O 2 at θ ˆ L and peak post-{NACRT} for predicting postoperative morbidity were 10.7 and 16.7 ( V ˙ O 2 at θ ˆ L – {AUC} = 0.72, 77\% sensitive and 83\% specific; V ˙ O 2 at peak – {AUC} = 0.80, 85\% sensitive and 83\% specific).
Conclusion
{NACRT} before major rectal cancer surgery significantly decreased physical fitness as assessed by {CPET}.

	abstract = {A prospective study was undertaken to assess postoperative renal dysfunction in patients with obstructive jaundice and to determine the effectiveness of dopamine in reducing its incidence. A total of 23 patients undergoing surgical relief of obstructive jaundice (serum bilirubin level above 100 mumol l-1) were randomized into two groups. Those in the control group (n = 10) received 3 litres 5 per cent dextrose intravenously during the 24 h before surgery plus a bolus of intravenous frusemide 1 mg kg-1 at induction of anaesthesia. The second group (n = 13) received a similar fluid and frusemide regimen plus an infusion of dopamine 3 micrograms kg-1 min-1 starting at induction of anaesthesia and continuing for 48 h after surgery. Postoperative oliguria occurred in two of the ten patients in the control group and in three of the 13 given dopamine (P = 0.74). No patient developed acute renal failure. There was no significant difference in mean levels of serum bilirubin, urea and creatinine, creatinine clearance and 24-h urinary output, on the day before and on days 1-5 after operation, between the two groups. It is concluded that, with careful preoperative resuscitation and control of fluid and electrolyte balance, the incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction in patients with obstructive jaundice is not as high as in some previous studies and is unaltered by administration of perioperative low-dose dopamine.},

Recently, there has been considerable interest in the potential impact of perioperative factors on long-term colorectal cancer outcome. Few studies have examined pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables in a single cohort. {METHODS}:: Four hundred and twenty-three patients with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer who underwent surgery with curative intent between 1997 and 2007 were included. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables were recorded. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of surgical complications and disease recurrence, respectively. {RESULTS}:: The postoperative mortality rate was 4\% and the morbidity rate 34\%. The most important predictors of complications were smoking (odd ratio [{OR}] 1.32), {ASA} grade ({OR} 1.90) and {POSSUM} operative score ({OR} 1.32).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The role of adjuvant treatment in pancreatic cancer remains uncertain. The European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer ({ESPAC}) assessed the roles of chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy in a randomised study. {METHODS}: After resection, patients were randomly assigned to adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (20 Gy in ten daily fractions over 2 weeks with 500 mg/m(2) fluorouracil intravenously on days 1-3, repeated after 2 weeks) or chemotherapy (intravenous fluorouracil 425 mg/m(2) and folinic acid 20 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days, monthly for 6 months). Clinicians could randomise patients into a two-by-two factorial design (observation, chemoradiotherapy alone, chemotherapy alone, or both) or into one of the main treatment comparisons (chemoradiotherapy versus no chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy). The primary endpoint was death, and all analyses were by intention to treat. Findings 541 eligible patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were randomised: 285 in the two-by-two factorial design (70 chemoradiotherapy, 74 chemotherapy, 72 both, 69 observation); a further 68 patients were randomly assigned chemoradiotherapy or no chemoradiotherapy and 188 chemotherapy or no chemotherapy.

One hundred and thirty-six (89 males, 47 females) were available for analysis. The median age was 71 [inter-quartile range ({IQR}) 62–77] yr. Sixty-five patients (48\%) had a complication at day 5 after operation. Measurements significantly lower in patients with complications than those without were O2 uptake (V˙O2\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}dot {VO}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 2\} ) at estimated lactate threshold (θ{\textasciicircum}L{\textbackslash}hat {\textbackslash}theta \_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\} ) [median 9.9 ({IQR} 8.3–12.7) vs 11.2 (9.5–14.2) ml kg−1 min−1, P{\textless}0.01], V˙O2\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}dot {VO}\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 2\} at peak [15.2 (12.6–18.1) vs 17.2 (13.7–22.5) ml kg−1 min−1, P=0.01], and ventilatory equivalent for {CO}2 (V˙E{\textbackslash}dot V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm E\} /V˙{CO}2\{{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash}dot {VCO}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 2\} ) at θ{\textasciicircum}L{\textbackslash}hat {\textbackslash}theta \_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\} [31.3 (28.0–34.8) vs 33.9 (30.0–39.1), P{\textless}0.01]. A final multivariable logistic regression model contained V˙O2\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}dot {VO}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 2\} at θ{\textasciicircum}L{\textbackslash}hat {\textbackslash}theta \_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\} \{one-point change odds ratio ({OR}) 0.77 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.66–0.89], P{\textless}0.0005; two-point change {OR} 0.61 (0.46–0.81) and gender [{OR} 4.42 (1.78–9.88), P=0.001]\}, and was reasonably able to discriminate those with and without complications ({AUC} 0.71, {CI} 0.62–0.80, 68\% sensitivity, 65\% specificity).
Conclusions {CPET} variables are associated with postoperative morbidity. A multivariable model with V˙O2\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}dot {VO}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 2\} at θ{\textasciicircum}L{\textbackslash}hat {\textbackslash}theta \_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\} and gender discriminates those with complications after colonic surgery.},

Approximately  4 months after their operation, patients were grouped according to the presence (n = 15) or absence (n = 21) of an acute-phase response (C-reactive protein {\textgreater} 5 mg/L) and were followed-up for a minimum of 24 months. {RESULTS}: Age, tumor site,  and serum carcinoembryonic antigen concentrations were similar in both groups.

Furthermore, the influence of obesity on the early results of surgery was assessed and the effect of preoperative weight reduction on perioperative complication rates examined. Obese patients had a greater incidence of left-stem coronary artery stenosis (p less than 0.001), hyperlipidaemia (p less than 0.05), hypertension (p less than 0.05), diabetes mellitus (p less than 0.02), and were in general younger at the time of operation (57.9 +/- 8.4 vs. 60.8 +/- 8.5 years). There were no differences in the surgery performed and in operative mortality, but there were some in perioperative morbidity. Obese patients had higher rates of infection (p less than 0.02), sternal dehiscence (p less than 0.02), arrhythmias (p less than 0.02) and myocardial infarction (p less than 0.02). No significant differences were identified in obese patients with or without preoperative weight reduction, although there was a trend of better postoperative recovery and results in patients having undergone preoperative weight reduction. Analysis of our results demonstrated obesity to be an independent risk factor for perioperative complications, hospital morbidity, and length of hospitalization.},

	abstract = {The acute-phase protein response is associated with accelerated weight loss and shortened survival in cancer. This may be due to hepatic protein synthesis increasing demand for amino acids. An n -3 fatty-acid-enriched nutritional supplement will moderate aspects of cachexia in cancer patients. The present study examined the effect of such a supplement on hepatic synthesis of albumin and fibrinogen. Albumin and fibrinogen synthesis were measured in the fed and fasting state in eight weight-losing patients with pancreatic cancer by an intravenous flooding dose technique. Tracer incorporation into proteins was measured by {GC}/{MS}. Patients were restudied after 3 weeks of oral supplement enriched with fish oil (providing 2510 {kJ}/day and 2 g of eicosapentaenoic acid/day). At baseline, all patients were losing weight (median, 2.4 kg/month). After 3 weeks of consumption of the fish-oil-enriched nutritional supplement, patients' weight stabilized (median change, +1 kg; P = 0.01). At baseline, albumin and fibrinogen synthesis rates were stimulated in the fed compared with the fasting state [14.2 compared with 11.3 g/day (29\% rise; P = 0.01) and 4.5 compared with 3.3 g/day (38\% rise; P = 0.01) respectively]. After 3 weeks of the  supplement, this stimulation in the fed state was no longer observed for albumin  and was reduced for fibrinogen [11.2 compared with 10.5 g/day (3\% rise; P = 0.21) and 3.7 compared with 2.9 g/day (17\% rise; P = 0.01) respectively]. After 3 weeks, the combined albumin plus fibrinogen synthetic rate tended to fall in the  fasting state (14.7 compared with 12.3 g/day; P = 0.09) and was significantly reduced in the fed state (18.7 compared with 14.6 g/day; P = 0.01).

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}
To evaluate time trends in surgical resection rates and operative mortality in older adults diagnosed with locoregional pancreatic cancer and to determine the effect of age on surgical resection rates and 2-year survival after surgical resection.

{DESIGN}
Retrospective cohort study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ({SEER}) and linked Medicare claims database (1992–2005).

{SETTING}
Secondary data analysis of population-based tumor registry and linked claims data.

{PARTICIPANTS}
Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 and older diagnosed with locoregional pancreatic cancer (N = 9,553), followed from date of diagnosis to time of death or censorship.

{MEASUREMENTS}
Percentage of participants undergoing surgical resection, 30-day operative mortality after resection, and 2-year survival according to age group.

{RESULTS}
Surgical resection rates increased significantly, from 20\% in 1992 to 29\% in 2005, whereas 30-day operative mortality rates decreased from 9\% to 5\%. After controlling for multiple factors, participants were less likely to be resected with older age. Resection was associated with lower hazard of death, regardless of age, with hazard ratios of 0.46, 0.51, 0.47, 0.43, and 0.35 for resected participants younger than 70, 70 to 74, 75 to 79, 80 to 84, and 85 and older respectively compared with unresected participants younger than 70 (P{\textless}.001).

{CONCLUSION}
With older age, fewer people with pancreatic cancer undergo surgical resection, even after controlling for comorbidity and other factors. This study demonstrated increased resection rates over time in all age groups, along with lower surgical mortality rates. Despite previous reports of greater morbidity and mortality after pancreatic resection in older adults, the benefit of resection does not diminish with older age in selected people.},

	abstract = {Background This study evaluated the role of the acute phase C-reactive protein ({CRP}) in the postoperative course of a large series of rectal resections on the basis of a prospective database. Main focus of this study was the early identification of complications. Materials and methods Three hundred eighty-three rectal resections with primary anastomosis for rectal cancer were screened for infectious postoperative complications. Forty-eight complicated cases were identified and matched with 48 patients with an uneventful postoperative course. Results In the postoperative setting, {CRP} peaked on postoperative day ({POD}) 2 with a median serum {CRP} of 140 mg/l and gradually declined thereafter in uncomplicated cases. In complicated cases, {CRP} elevation generally persisted after {POD} 2, whereas white blood cells and body temperature were within normal range in the early postoperative period. A cutoff {CRP} value of 140 mg/dl on {PODs} 3 and 4 resulted in predictive values of 85.7 and 90.5\% (adjusted to the prevalence: 37.6 and 50.3\%), sensitivities of 80.0 and 54.3\%, and specificities of 81.0 and 92.3\% for a complicated postoperative course (P {\textless} 0.001), respectively. Conclusion Persistent {CRP} elevation and elevation of serum {CRP} above 140 mg/dl on {PODs} 3–4 are predictive of infectious postoperative complications and should prompt intense clinical search for an inflammatory process, especially for an anastomotic leak if pneumonia and wound infection are unlikely or excluded.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}/{PURPOSE}: Major hepatectomy with concomitant pancreatoduodenectomy (M-{HPD}) is usually indicated for the resection of diffuse bile duct cancer or advanced gallbladder cancer. This is the only procedure that can potentially cure such advanced cancers, so both a low mortality rate and long-term survival could potentially justify performing this procedure. {METHODS}: Between 1990 and 2005, the morbidity, mortality, and long-term survival of 26 patients with advanced biliary tract carcinoma 14 with diffuse bile duct cancer, 9 with advanced gallbladder cancer, and 3 with hilar bile duct cancer, who underwent hepatopancreatoduodectomy ({HPD}) were reviewed and analyzed. {RESULTS}: The overall morbidity and mortality rates were 30.8\% and 0\%, respectively. Postoperative infectious complications occurred in 6 patients (23.0\%). The 5-year survival rate of the 14 patients with diffuse bile duct cancer who underwent {HPD} was 51.9\%, while the 5-year survival rate in the 12 of these patients who underwent M-{HPD} was 61.4\%. Patients with diffuse bile duct cancer without residual tumor and those without lymph node metastasis had 5-year survival rates of 68.6\% and 80\%, respectively. Thirty-three percent (2 of 6) of the patients who underwent M-{HPD} for advanced gallbladder cancer survived for more than 5 years. {CONCLUSIONS}: Preoperative biliary drainage, portal embolization, complete external drainage of pancreatic juice, reduction of intraoperative bleeding, and prevention of bacterial colonization of bile may enable the incidence of mortality and hepatic failure to approach zero in patients who undergo {HPD}. Surgeons should strive for complete clearance of the tumor with a negative surgical margin to achieve long-term survival when performing M-{HPD}.},

	doi = {10.1381/09608920160556715},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: It is well established that morbid obesity affects the respiratory system and the diastolic function of the heart. During exercise, cardiopulmonary reserve is exhausted because of augmented requirements, leading to a significant intolerance. A study was undertaken to investigate the influence of body weight loss on the characteristics of the left ventricle ({LV}) and on exercise capacity in obese patients before and 6 months, following vertical banded gastroplasty ({VBG}).
{METHODS}: 16 morbidly obese individuals ({BMI} {\textgreater} 40 kg/m2) scheduled for {VBG} were studied. A symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test and a complete transthoracic echocardiogram were performed 1 day before operation and 6 months postoperatively (after the patients achieved a body weight loss of {\textgreater} 20\% of their pre-operative values).
{RESULTS}: Exercise duration increased significantly 6 months following surgery. The mean O2 consumption at peak exercise (peak {VO}2) and at the anaerobic threshold ({VO}2AT) was significantly higher after weight loss. 6 months after {VBG} the {LV} thickness decreased significantly. Regarding the diastolic indices, isovolumic relaxation time ({IVRT}) and early/late (E/A) velocity ratio, there was a significant improvement after weight loss. Simple linear regression analysis revealed that peak {VO}2 and {VO}2AT were significantly correlated with {IVRT} and E/A velocity ratio.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Weight loss after {VBG} improves the cardiac diastolic function and this is associated with an improvement in cardiopulmonary exercise performance. Left ventricular filling variables could be considered among the most important determinants of exercise intolerance in obese individuals.},

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that, in most patients with advanced cancer, weight  loss is associated with an inflammatory response. To examine the temporal relationship between weight loss, appetite, performance status, and the inflammatory response, 50 patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer with weight loss were observed for six weeks. Patients were grouped according to whether they had lost weight ({\textgreater} 3\%, n = 16), were weight stable ({\textless} 3\% change, n = 25), or gained weight ({\textgreater} 3\%, n = 9). At baseline, the group that subsequently lost weight had lower albumin and higher C-reactive protein concentrations (p {\textless} 0.05). On follow-up, there was an increase in C-reactive protein concentration and reductions in triceps skinfold thickness and Karnofsky performance status in  the weight-losing group (p {\textless} 0.05). In contrast, Karnofsky performance status was improved in the group that gained weight (p {\textless} 0.05). Over the six to eight weeks, there was a difference in the changes of triceps skinfold thickness (p {\textless} 0.05) and Karnofsky performance status (p {\textless} 0.01) between the two groups. These results suggest that loss or gain of {\textgreater} 2.5 kg over a six- to eight-week period is required to produce a significant alteration in performance status in weight-losing patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Moreover, the results suggest that the presence of an inflammatory response is associated with further  weight loss and the deterioration of performance status.},

This study examined the prognostic value of tumour necrosis and host inflammatory responses in colorectal cancer. {METHODS}: This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing potentially curative resection of colorectal cancer at a single surgical institution over a 10-year period. Patients who underwent preoperative radiotherapy were excluded. The systemic and  local inflammatory responses were assessed using the modified Glasgow Prognostic  Score and Klintrup-Makinen criteria respectively. Original tumour sections were retrieved and necrosis graded as absent, focal, moderate or extensive. Associations between necrosis and clinicopathological variables were examined, and multivariable survival analyses carried out. {RESULTS}: A total of 343 patients were included between 1997 and 2007. Tumour necrosis was graded as absent in 32 (9.3 per cent), focal in 166 (48.4 per cent), moderate in 101 (29.4 per cent) and extensive in 44 (12.8 per cent). There were significant associations between tumour necrosis and anaemia (P = 0.022), white cell count (P = 0.006), systemic inflammatory response (P {\textless} 0.001), local inflammatory cell infiltrate (P = 0.004), tumour node metastasis ({TNM}) stage (P = 0.015) and Petersen Index (P = 0.003). On univariable survival analysis, tumour necrosis was associated with cancer-specific survival (P {\textless} 0.001). On multivariable survival analysis, age (hazard ratio ({HR}) 1.29, 95 per cent confidence interval 1.00 to 1.66), systemic  inflammatory response ({HR} 1.74, 1.27 to 2.39), low-grade local inflammatory cell  infiltrate ({HR} 2.65, 1.52 to 4.63), {TNM} stage ({HR} 1.55, 1.02 to 2.35) and high-risk Petersen Index ({HR} 3.50, 2.21 to 5.55) were associated with reduced cancer-specific survival. {CONCLUSION}: The impact of tumour necrosis on colorectal cancer survival may be due to close associations with the host systemic and local inflammatory responses.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a 12-week aerobic exercise program positively impacts heart rate variability ({HRV}) and functional capacity after gastric bypass surgery ({GBS}) in a female cohort.
{METHODS}: Of the 52 patients initially recruited, 21 were randomized to a training group ({TG}) or control group and successfully completed the study. Patients were tested on two occasions: 1 week before {GBS} and 4 months after {GBS}. Anthropometric variables, body composition, record of heart rate and R-R intervals, and 6-min walk test (6MWT) were assessed at both time points. The {TG} underwent an aerobic exercise training program on a treadmill (1-h session, totaling 36 sessions over 12 weeks).
{RESULTS}: The main findings from this study were: (1) only the {TG} demonstrated a significant increase (p {\textless} 0.05) in all indexes of heart rate variability ({HRV}) after 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training and (2) only the {TG} demonstrated a significant increase (p {\textless} 0.05) in 6MWT distance and decrease in diastolic blood pressure after aerobic exercise training.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the least common tumors, nevertheless it is one of the most lethal. This lethality is mainly due to the fact that the vast majority of patients are diagnosed in an advanced stage. The objective of this work is investigate how different covariates affect the transition to death after a first admission due to pancreatic cancer.
Methods
We analyze the impact of different factors on health related transitions after a first hospital admission related to pancreatic cancer based on a multi state model.
Results
Transitions of interest include the transition to death (i.e. survival time), but also the time between a first admission and discharge or between discharge and readmission. We consider comorbidities, the type of admission, and especially the performance of pancreas surgery as covariates with a potential effect on the transition intensities.
Conclusion
The multi state model allows for a very detailed analysis since all covariate effects may change depending on the current state of the patient.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}: There is now good evidence in humans that a chronic systemic inflammatory response results in the cardinal features of cancer cachexia, principally the progressive loss of weight (in particular lean tissue). This review examines the role of recent simple objective systemic inflammation-based scores in predicting reduction of nutritional status and survival. {RECENT} {FINDINGS}: The most common measure of the systemic inflammatory response in cancer patients has been an elevated C-reactive protein concentration. This has now been included in recent definitions of cancer cachexia. There are also recent systemic inflammation-based scores, the Glasgow Prognostic Score, Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio and the Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio that have been shown to have prognostic value in cancer patients. These scores, in particular the Glasgow Prognostic Score, enable identification of patients who are, or likely, to develop cachexia, have a poor response to treatment and who are likely to have poor survival. {SUMMARY}: A chronic systemic inflammatory response is clearly implicated in the progressive nutritional and functional decline in the cancer patients and their subsequent poor outcome. Systemic inflammation-based prognostic scores not only identify patients at risk but also provide well defined therapeutic targets for future clinical trials targeting nutritional decline.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate whether socioeconomic deprivation is associated with cause specific and all cause survival for colorectal cancer and to what extent this is independent of significant prognostic factors. Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: The former Wessex Health Region, South West England. Participants: All patients resident in Wessex registered with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer over three years (n=5176). Survival analysis was carried out on those patients with compete data for all factors and a positive survival time (n=4419). Outcomes: Death from colorectal cancer and all cause over five year follow up from initial diagnosis. Main results: Deprivation was significantly associated with survival for both outcomes in univariate analysis; the unadjusted hazard ratio for dying from colorectal cancer (most deprived compared with most affluent) was 1.12 (95\% Cl 1.00 to 1.25) and for all cause was 1.18 (1.07 to 1.30). Significant prognostic factors for both outcomes were age, specialisation of surgeon, Dukes's stage, and emergency compared with elective surgery. Comorbidity and gender were only associated with all cause survival. After adjustment for prognostic factors, the effect of deprivation on both cause specific and all cause mortality was reduced, and it was non-significant for colorectal cancer. However, the most deprived group had consistently worse survival than the most affluent. Conclusions: Factors associated with survival with colorectal cancer depend on the outcome measure. Socioeconomic deprivation is adversely associated with survival in patients with colorectal cancer. This is strongest for non-colorectal cancer death, partly reflecting higher comorbidity, but it is there for colorectal cancer though not statistically significant. Conclusive evidence of the inequalities by socioeconomic status and underlying reasons needs to come from studies using individual based measures of socioeconomic status and more detail on treatment and host related factors.},

	abstract = {Background
This population-based study investigated the relationship between individual and neighborhood socioeconomic status ({SES}) and mortality rates for major cancers in Taiwan.

Methods
A population-based follow-up study was conducted with 20,488 cancer patients diagnosed in 2002. Each patient was traced to death or for 5 years. The individual income-related insurance payment amount was used as a proxy measure of individual {SES} for patients. Neighborhood {SES} was defined by income, and neighborhoods were grouped as living in advantaged or disadvantaged areas. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the death-free survival rates between the different {SES} groups after adjusting for possible confounding and risk factors.

Results
After adjusting for patient characteristics (age, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index Score, urbanization, and area of residence), tumor extent, treatment modalities (operation and adjuvant therapy), and hospital characteristics (ownership and teaching level), colorectal cancer, and head and neck cancer patients under 65 years old with low individual {SES} in disadvantaged neighborhoods conferred a 1.5 to 2-fold higher risk of mortality, compared with patients with high individual {SES} in advantaged neighborhoods. A cross-level interaction effect was found in lung cancer and breast cancer. Lung cancer and breast cancer patients less than 65 years old with low {SES} in advantaged neighborhoods carried the highest risk of mortality. Prostate cancer patients aged 65 and above with low {SES} in disadvantaged neighborhoods incurred the highest risk of mortality. There was no association between {SES} and mortality for cervical cancer and pancreatic cancer.

Conclusions
Our findings indicate that cancer patients with low individual {SES} have the highest risk of mortality even under a universal health-care system. Public health strategies and welfare policies must continue to focus on this vulnerable group.},

One hundred eight postmenopausal (60 +/- 6 years), overweight and obese (body mass index [{BMI}] = 33 +/- 4 kg/m(2)), sedentary (Vo(2)max = 19 +/- 3 ml/kg/min) women underwent one exercise test (Bruce protocol), and 71 of these women underwent a second test (modified Balke protocol). On test 1, 69 (64\%) women achieved age-predicted {HRmax}, 61 (57\%) reached an {RER}{\textgreater}1.10, and 16 (15\%) achieved a plateau in Vo(2) ({\textless}2 ml/kg/min change). Women who reached age-predicted {HRmax} and reached an {RER} of at least 1.10 had a higher peak Vo(2) (p {\textless}0.01) than women who did not meet these criteria. There was no difference in the highest V02 obtained between women who did and did not achieve a plateau in Vo(2) during test 1 (p = 0.55). Resting {HR}, {HRmax}, and {RER} were similar between the two tests. On average, peak Vo(2) was higher on the second test (p {\textless}0.01). However, Vo(2)max was not different between exercise tests in women who achieved at least two of the three criteria on both tests (n = 24; test 1, 19.4 +/- 3.4; test 2: 19.8 +/- 3.7 ml/kg/min; p = {NS}). In addition, Vo(2)max was similar between the two exercise tests in 14 women who reached a plateau on the second test but did not reach a plateau on the first test (19.2 +/- 3.3 vs. 19.6 +/- 4.2 ml/kg/min; p = {NS}). We conclude that achievement of a plateau in Vo(2) is not a necessary criterion for a valid measurement of Vo(2)max in overweight and obese, sedentary, postmenopausal women.},

	abstract = {The tendency for short hospitalization after lumbar microdiscectomy implies the need for early confirmation or disapproval of serious postoperative infections such as spondylodiscitis or deep wound infections. The C-reactive protein ({CRP}) is a well-known screening parameter for monitoring postoperative infectious complications in other fields. Our objective was to establish the diagnostic significance of {CRP}-in comparison with {ESR} and {WBC}-for monitoring infectious complications after lumbar microdiscectomy. Over a 15 months period we studied prospectively a homogeneous group of N = 400 patients with lumbar disc herniations who were operated on a single level for the first time. {CRP}, {ESR} and {WBC} values were determined in all patients pre-operatively, and on postoperative days 1 and 5. Clinical and laboratory findings were correlated and the diagnostic significance of {CRP}, {ESR} and {WBC} calculated. N = 385 (96\%) patients had an uneventful postoperative course. N = 15 (4\%) patients developed infectious complications, of which N = 6 (1.5\%) were unrelated and N = 9 (2.5\%) related to surgery. Evaluation of the laboratory values showed: The {CRP} baseline is a very individual value of no prognostic relevance. A high postaggression peak is typical and essential as a reference value for only the future time course will disclose any infection. We found 0\% false negative and 4\% false positive results on day 5. The sensitivity for serial {CRP} testing was calculated as 100\% and specificity as 95.8\%. {ESR} (sensitivity: 78.1\%/specificity: 38.1\%) and {WBC} (sensitivity: 21.4\%/specificity: 76.8\%) both failed to reach such distinct diagnostic significance on day 5. The C-reactive protein has thus proved to be a reliable, simple and economical screening test for infectious complications after lumbar microdiscectomy, superior to classical laboratory parameters.},

The basis of this relationship with survival is not known; however, systemic inflammation may reflect comorbidity. The present study examines relationships between host factors (including age, comorbidity, deprivation, and systemic inflammation) and survival in {CRC}. Methods A total of 302 patients underwent curative elective {CRC} resection between 1997 and 2005. Data was collected on patient comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index [{CCI}], Lee Cardiac Risk Index [{LCRI}], National Institute on Aging and National Cancer Institute Comorbidity Index [{NIA}/{NCI}], and Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 [{ACE}-27]), systemic inflammatory response (Glasgow Prognostic Score [{mGPS}]), deprivation [Carstairs Deprivation Index], body mass index, and smoking status. Results For cancer-specific survival, age (P = 0.047), tumor, node, metastasis system stage (P {\textless} 0.001), high-risk Petersen Index (P {\textless} 0.001), {LCRI} (P = 0.021), and {mGPS} (P {\textless} 0.001) were independent factors by multivariate analysis. For overall survival, age (P {\textless} 0.001), tumor, node, metastasis system stage (P = 0.001), high-risk Petersen Index (P = 0.002), postoperative infective complications (P = 0.002), {ACE}-27 (P = 0.008), and {mGPS} (P {\textless} 0.001) were independent factors. Older age related to increasing comorbidity ({ACE}-27, {CCI}, {LCRI} [P {\textless} 0.005]) and increased {mGPS} (P {\textless} 0.005). Smoking and deprivation related to increasing comorbidity (P {\textless} 0.05). The {mGPS} was associated with high comorbidity burden assessed with {ACE}-27 (P = 0.065), {CCI} (P = 0.016), {LCRI} (P = 0.095), and {NIA}/{NCI} (P = 0.084). Conclusions Comorbidity does not fully explain the relationship between the {mGPS} and cancer-specific survival in {CRC} patients. Furthermore, comorbidity, in particular that measured by the {LCRI}, is an important independent indicator of cancer survival.},

	volume = {6},
	doi = {10.2217/fon.09.136},
	abstract = {Disease progression in cancer is dependent on the complex interaction between the tumor and the host inflammatory response. There is substantial evidence in advanced cancer that host factors, such as weight loss, poor performance status and the host systemic inflammatory response, are linked, and the latter is an important tumor-stage-independent predictor of outcome. Indeed, the systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by an elevated level of C-reactive protein, is now included in the definition of cancer cachexia. This review examines the role of the systemic inflammatory response in predicting survival in patients with primary operable cancer. Approximately 80 studies have evaluated the role of the systemic inflammatory response using biochemical or hematological markers, such as elevated C-reactive protein levels, hypoalbuminemia or increased white cell, neutrophil and platelet counts. Combinations of such factors have been used to derive simple inflammation-based prognostic scores, such as the Glasgow Prognostic Score, the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio and the platelet:lymphocyte ratio. This review demonstrates that there is now good evidence that preoperative measures of the systemic inflammatory response predict cancer survival, independent of tumor stage, in primary operable cancer. The evidence is particularly robust in colorectal (including liver metastases), gastro-esophageal and renal cancers. As described in this article, measurement of the systemic inflammatory response is simple, reliable and can be clinically incorporated into current staging algorithms. This will provide the clinician with a better prediction of outcome, and therefore better treatment allocation in patients with primary operable cancer. Furthermore, systemic inflammation-based markers and prognostic scores not only identify patients at risk, but also provide well-defined therapeutic targets for future clinical trials.},

The aim of the present study was to  compare the prognostic value of an inflammation-based prognostic score (modified  Glasgow Prognostic Score (Mgps) 0=C-reactive protein {\textless}10 mg l(-1), 1=C-reactive protein {\textgreater}10 mg l(-1), and 2=C-reactive protein {\textgreater}10 mg l(-1) and albumin{\textless}35 g l(-1)) with that of components of the white cell count (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and platelets using standard thresholds) in patients with colorectal cancer. Two patient groups were studied: 149 patients who underwent potentially curative resection for colorectal cancer and 84 patients who had synchronous unresectable liver metastases. In those patients who underwent potentially curative resection the minimum follow-up was 36 months and 20 patients died of their cancer. On multivariate survival analysis only {TNM} stage ({HR} 3.75, 95\% {CI} 1.54-9.17, P=0.004), monocyte count ({HR} 3.79, 95\% {CI} 1.29-11.12, P=0.015) and {mGPS} ({HR} 2.21, 95\% {CI} 1.11-4.41, P=0.024) were independently associated with cancer-specific survival.

{METHODS}: Florida cancer registry and inpatient hospital data were queried for pancreatic adenocarcinoma diagnosed from 1998 to 2002.
{RESULTS}: In total, 16,104 patients were identified. Low {SES} ({LSES}) patients were younger at diagnosis (P {\textless} .001) but presented with similar disease stage and tumor grade. {LSES} patients were less likely to receive surgical extirpation (16.5\% vs 19.8\%; P {\textless} .001), chemotherapy (30.7\% vs 36.4\%; P {\textless} .001), or radiotherapy (14.3\% vs 16.9\%; P = .003). Among surgical patients, 30-day mortality was significantly higher (5.1\% vs 3.7\%; P {\textless} .001) and overall median survival was significantly worse (5.0 months vs 6.2 months; P {\textless} .001) in the {LSES} cohorts. Although surgical patients who were treated at teaching facilities ({TF}) did significantly better; an increased 30-day surgical mortality (2.2\% vs 1.3\%; P {\textless} .001) and decreased median survival (5 months for poverty level {\textgreater}15\% vs 6.2 months for poverty level {\textless}5\%; P {\textless} .001) also were observed for patients of {LSES}.

Recent work has focused on estimating perioperative risk in patients with liver disease. Hemodynamic instability in the perioperative period can worsen liver function in patients with liver disease. Operative risk correlates with the severity of the underlying liver disease and the nature of the surgical procedure. Thorough preoperative evaluation is necessary prior to elective surgery. Surgery is contraindicated in patients with certain conditions, such as acute hepatitis, acute liver failure, and alcoholic hepatitis. Estimation of perioperative mortality is inexact because of the retrospective nature of and biased patient selection in available clinical studies. The Child-Pugh classification (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score) and particulary the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease ({MELD}) score provide reasonable estimations of perioperative mortality but do not replace the need for careful preoperative preparation and postoperative monitoring, as early detection of complications is essential for improving outcomes.

We examined different methods of assessing the local inflammatory response in colorectal tumours and explored relationships with both clinicopathological characteristics and survival. {METHODS}: Cohort study of patients (n=130) with primary operable colorectal cancer and mature follow-up. Local inflammatory response at the invasive margin was assessed with: (1) a semi-quantitative assessment of peritumoural inflammation using Klintrup-Makinen  (K-M) grading and (2) an assessment of individual immune cell infiltration (lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, macrophages and eosinophils). {RESULTS}: The peritumoural inflammatory response was K-M low grade in 48\% and high grade in 52\%. Inflammatory cells were primarily macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils with relatively few plasma cells or eosinophils. On univariate analysis, K-M grade, lymphocyte infiltration and plasma cell infiltration were associated with  cancer-specific survival. On multivariate analysis, only systemic inflammatory response, {TNM} (tumour, node and metastases) stage, venous invasion, tumour necrosis and K-M grade were independently associated with cancer-specific survival. There was no relationship between local infiltration of inflammatory cells and a systemic inflammatory response. However, high K-M grade, lymphocyte infiltration and plasma cell infiltration were associated with a number of favourable pathological characteristics, including an absence of venous invasion. {CONCLUSION}: Infiltration of inflammatory cells in the invasive margin of colorectal tumours is beneficial to survival.

	abstract = {Progressive involuntary weight loss, in particular the loss of lean tissue, is common in patients with advanced cancer and has long been recognised to result in a deterioration in performance status and quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality. The aetiology of such weight loss or cachexia is complex and involves both tumour and host responses. Thus, identification of patients who are or are likely to become cachectic has been problematic. In addition to a reduction in appetite and increased satiety leading to poor dietary intake, there is now increasing clinical evidence that the activation of a chronic ongoing systemic inflammatory response is one of the earliest and most important contributory factors to cachexia. Such findings help to explain the failure of simple nutritional programmes to reverse weight loss adequately in patients with  cancer. In the present paper the development of an inflammation-based score is described, which is derived from the acute-phase proteins C-reactive protein and  albumin and is termed the Glasgow prognostic score ({GPS}). Its value as a predictor of survival, independent of tumour stage, performance status and treatment (active or palliative), has been shown in a variety of advanced common  solid tumours. The nature of the relationship between the {GPS}, appetite, body composition, performance status and quality of life of the patient with advanced  cancer will be described. Recently, it has become evident that the systemic inflammatory response is also present in a smaller proportion of patients with primary operable cancer and is also predictive of disease progression and poor survival. The role of {GPS} in clinical decision making will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Objectives

To assess the reliability of magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) to measure fetal fat volume in utero, and to study fetal growth in women with and without diabetes in view of the increased prevalence of macrosomia in the former.


Methods

We studied 26 pregnant women, 14 with pre-gestational diabetes and 12 non-diabetic controls. Fetal assessment took place at 24 weeks' gestation and again at 34 weeks by standard ultrasound biometry followed by {MRI} at 1.5 T. Fetal fat volume was determined from T1-weighted water-suppressed images using a semi-automated approach based on pixel intensity and taking into account partial volume effects. Fetal volume was also determined from the {MRI} images. Fetal weight was calculated using published fat and lean tissue densities.


Results

There was little fetal fat at 24 weeks' gestation, but at 34 weeks the fetal fat content was considerably higher in the women with diabetes, with a mean fat content of 1090 ± 417 cm3 compared with 541 ± 348 cm3 in the controls (P = 0.006). Measurements of fetal fat volume showed low intra- and interobserver variability at 34 weeks, with intraclass correlation coefficients consistently above 0.99. Birth-weight centile correlated with fetal fat volume (R2 = 0.496, P {\textless} 0.001), percentage of fetal fat (R2 = 0.362, P = 0.008) and calculated fetal weight (R2 = 0.492, P {\textless} 0.001) at 34 weeks.


Conclusions

{MRI} appears to be a promising tool for the determination of fetal fat, body composition and weight in utero during the third trimester of pregnancy. Copyright © 2013 {ISUOG}. Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

We studied a total of 91 premenopausal women (34 obese, 39 with {AN}, and 18 lean controls).

	abstract = {Necrosectomy with postoperative continuous local lavage was performed in a prospective study involving 95 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. In the same period 567 patients with oedematous-interstitial pancreatitis were treated non-operatively with a hospital mortality rate of 0.7 per cent. In patients with necrotizing pancreatitis the median Ranson criteria score was 4.5 points; operation was required at a median of 7 days after the onset of symptoms because of non-response to conservative treatment. In all, 59 per cent of the patients (56 out of 95) developed extended intrapancreatic parenchymal necrosis, 70 per cent had ascites, and 66 per cent had intra- and extrapancreatic necrosis; 42 per cent of the patients had bacterial infection of the necrotic tissue. For lavage a median of 8 l/24 h of fluid were instilled postoperatively for 25 days (median). The lavage fluid showed high levels of immunoreactive trypsin, phospholipase A2, and endotoxin in the early postoperative period. Hospital mortality rate was 8.4 per cent. Necrosectomy and continuous postoperative lavage can achieve high survival rates in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. Postoperative local lavage allows the continuous non-operative evacuation of biologically active compounds and devitalized tissue, and avoids damage to remaining vital exocrine and endocrine pancreatic tissue.},

An assessment of cardiac and pulmonary responses to exercise-induced stress (i.e. cardiopulmonary exercise testing) using a bicycle ergometer, metabolic cart (to measure oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide excretion) and a 12 lead electrocardiograph has been found to be a non.invasive test that is quick, cheap, easy to perform and requires no special preparation. It has advantages over any other preoperative test by defining operative risk and allowing logical triage according to objective risk assessment. It is able to objectively evaluate the extent of any cardiac failure (by assessing the anaerobic threshold), myocardial ischaemia, provides insight into stroke index, the presence of pulmonary artery hypertension and defines obstructive and restrictive lung disease and ventilation perfusion inequality better than conventional preoperative respiratory function tests. {CONCLUSIONS}: In patients who are about to undergo major intra-abdominal surgery, preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing is an excellent predictor of risk in the postoperative period. No other test is able to offer such a comprehensive preoperative risk evaluation for an operative patient.},

	doi = {10.1038/sj.bjc.6603387},
	abstract = {The systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by elevated circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein, is a stage-independent prognostic factor in patients undergoing curative nephrectomy for localised renal cancer. However, it  is not clear whether the systemic inflammatory response arises from the tumour per se or as a result of an impaired immune cytokine response. The aim of the present study was to examine C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 concentrations before and following curative resection of renal cancer. Sixty-four patients with malignant renal disease and 12 with benign disease, undergoing resection were studied. Preoperatively, a blood sample was collected for routine laboratory analysis with a further sample stored before analysis of interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ({ELISA}) technique. The blood sampling procedure and analyses were repeated at approximately 3 months following resection. Circulating concentrations of both interleukin-6 and interleukin (P{\textless} or =0.01) were higher and a greater proportion  were elevated (P{\textless}0.05) in malignant compared with benign disease. The renal cancer patients were grouped according to whether they had evidence of a systemic inflammatory response. In the inflammatory group T stage was higher (P{\textless}0.01), both interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 concentrations were higher (P{\textless}0.001) and elevated (P{\textless}0.10) compared with the non-inflammatory group. Tumour volume was weakly correlated with C-reactive protein (r(2)=0.20, P=0.002), interleukin-6 (r(2)=0.20, P=0.002) and interleukin-10 (r(2)=0.24, P=0.001). Following nephrectomy the proportion of patients with elevated C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 concentrations did not alter significantly. An elevated preoperative C-reactive protein was associated with increased tumour stage, interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 concentrations. However, resection of the primary tumour did not appear to be associated with significant normalisation of  circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 or interleukin-10. Therefore, the presence of systemic inflammatory response is unlikely to be solely be determined by the tumour itself, but may be as a result  of an impaired immune cytokine response in patients with renal cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: An "obesity paradox," in which overweight and obese individuals with established cardiovascular disease have a better prognosis than normal weight subjects, has been reported in a number of clinical cohorts, but little is known about the effects of weight loss on the obesity paradox and its association with health outcomes.
{METHODS}: Weight was determined in 3834 men at the time of a clinically referred exercise test and again during a clinical evaluation a mean of 7 years later. The associations among weight changes, baseline fitness, and other risk markers with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were determined by Cox proportional hazards analysis.
{RESULTS}: During the follow-up period, 314 subjects died (72 of cardiovascular causes). In a multivariate analysis (including baseline weight, weight change, exercise capacity, and cardiovascular disease), weight gain was associated with lower mortality and weight loss was associated with higher mortality (4\% higher per pound lost per year, P{\textless}.001) compared with stable weight. For all-cause mortality, the relative risks for the no change, weight gain, and weight loss groups were 1.0 (referent), 0.64 (95\% confidence interval, 0.50-0.83), and 1.49 (95\% confidence interval, 1.17-1.89), respectively (P{\textless}.001). Those who died and exhibited weight loss had a significantly higher prevalence of deaths due to cancer and cardiovascular causes.
{CONCLUSION}: Weight loss was related to higher mortality and weight gain was related to lower mortality when compared with stable weight. The obesity paradox in our sample is explained in part by a combination of non-volitional weight loss related to occult disease and a protective effect of weight gain.},

These limitations could be overcome by irreversible electroporation—a novel, non-thermal ablative method that is gaining popularity for the treatment of many soft tissue tumors, including those of the pancreas. This review summarizes the status of this technique in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Most of the evidence on efficacy and safety is based on non-randomized prospective series, which show that irreversible electroporation may improve overall survival and pain control in locally advanced pancreatic cancer. As experience with this procedure increases, randomized controlled trials are needed to document its efficacy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer more precisely.},

	abstract = {Background

This study investigated the relationship between objectively measured physical fitness variables derived by cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) and in-hospital morbidity after rectal cancer surgery.


Methods

Patients scheduled for rectal cancer surgery underwent preoperative {CPET} (reported blind to patient characteristics) with recording of morbidity (recorded blind to {CPET} variables). Non-parametric receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curves and logistic regression were used to assess the relationship between {CPET} variables and postoperative morbidity.


Results

Of 105 patients assessed, 95 (72 men) were included; ten patients had no surgery and were excluded (3 by choice, 7 owing to unresectable metastasis). Sixty-eight patients had received neoadjuvant treatment. {ROC} curve analysis of oxygen uptake (V˙o2) at estimated lactate threshold (θ{\textasciicircum}L) and peak V˙o2 gave an area under the {ROC} curve of 0·87 (95 per cent confidence interval 0·78 to 0·95; P {\textless} 0·001) and 0·85 (0·77 to 0·93; P {\textless} 0·001) respectively, indicating that they can help discriminate patients at risk of postoperative morbidity. The optimal cut-off points identified were 10·6 and 18·6 ml per kg per min for V˙o2 at θ{\textasciicircum}L and peak respectively.


Conclusion

{CPET} can help predict morbidity after rectal cancer surgery.},

To clarify the mechanism of this phenomenon, we compared the contractile response to isoprenaline of isolated ventricular preparations from three groups of dogs: (a) dogs with chronic bile-duct ligation ({CBDL}), (b) dogs with choledochocaval anastomosis ({CDCA}) and (c) sham-operated dogs ({SO}). Isolated ventricular muscles from {CBDL} and {CDCA} dogs showed a depressed contractile response to isoprenaline as compared with {SO} dogs. Mechanical performance was spared in the {CBDL} and {CDCA} dogs. There were no differences in the contractile responses of {SO} and {CBDL} dogs, either to ouabain or to changes in the rates of stimulation (force-frequency relationships). These data demonstrate that, in the dog, obstructive jaundice and/or cholaemia are associated with blunted contractile response to beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation in the face of intact basic mechanical performance. Similar inotropic refractoriness to beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation could contribute to the susceptibility to postoperative shock in patients with obstructive jaundice.},

Cancer cachexia and its associated clinical symptoms, including weight loss, altered body composition, poor functional status, poor food intake, and poorer quality of life, have long been recognised as indicators of poorer prognosis in the patient with cancer. In  order to make some progress a starting point is to have general agreement on what constitutes cancer cachexia. In recent years a plethora of different definitions  and consensus statements have been proposed as a framework for investigation and  treatment of this debilitating and terminal condition. However, there are significant differences in the criteria used in these and all include poorly defined or subjective criteria and their prognostic value has not been established. The aim of the present review was to examine the hypothesis that a systemic inflammatory response accounts for most of the effect of cancer cachexia and its associated clinical symptoms on poor outcome in patients with cancer.

	abstract = {Background
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) has become well established in the preoperative assessment of patients presenting for major surgery in the United Kingdom. There is evidence supporting its use in risk-stratifying patients prior to major high-risk surgical procedures., We set out to establish how {CPET} services in England have developed since the only survey on this subject was undertaken in 2008 (J Intensive Care Soc 2009, 10:275–278).

Methods
Availability of preoperative {CPET} and contact details were collected via a telephone survey and email invites to complete the online survey were sent to all contacts. The survey was live during March and April 2011.

Results
We received 123 (74\%) responses from the 166 emails that were sent out. In total, 32\% (53/166) of all adult anesthetic departments in England have access to preoperative {CPET} services and a further 4\% (6) were in the process of setting up services. The number of departments offering preoperative {CPET}, including those in the process of setting up services, has risen from 42 in 2008 to 59 in 2011, a rise of over 40\%. Only 61\% of the clinics are run by anesthetists and 39\% of clinics have trained cardiorespiratory technicians assisting in the performance of the test. Most of the clinics (55\%) rely solely on a bicycle ergometer. Vascular surgical patients are the largest group of patients tested, and the majority of tests are run to a symptom-limited maximum. We estimate that 15,000 tests are performed annually for preoperative assessment in England. Only 37\% of respondents were confident that the tests performed were being billed for.

Conclusions
{CPET} is increasing in popularity as a preoperative risk assessment tool. There remains a lack of consistency in the way tests are reported and utilized. The results highlight the extent and diversity of the use of preoperative {CPET} and the potential for further research into its use in unstudied patient groups.},

	abstract = {Weight-losing patients with advanced cancer often fail to gain weight with conventional nutritional support. This suboptimal response might be explained, in part, by an increased metabolic response to feeding. It has been suggested that eicosapentaenoic acid ({EPA}) can modify beneficially the metabolic response to cancer. The aim of the present study was to examine the metabolic response to feeding in cancer and the effects of an {EPA}-enriched oral food supplement on this response. A total of 16 weight-losing, non-diabetic patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma and six healthy, weight-stable controls were studied by indirect calorimetry in the fasting and fed states. Body composition was estimated by bioimpedence analysis. Cancer patients were then given a fish-oil-enriched nutritional supplement providing 2 g of {EPA} and 2550 {kJ} daily,  and underwent repeat metabolic study after 3 weeks of such supplementation. At baseline, resting energy expenditure whether expressed per kg body weight, lean body mass or body cell mass was significantly greater in the cancer patients compared with controls.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Whether preoperative biliary drainage ({PBD}) is beneficial in reducing complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy is controversial. There remains a reluctance to consider pancreaticoduodenectomy in older patients. The major source of morbidity and potential mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy is pancreatic fistula, which is caused by difficulties associated with the pancreatic anastomosis. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of {PBD}, patient age and method of pancreatico-enteric reconstruction on postoperative morbidity and mortality. {METHODS}: A total of 104 consecutive patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy between November 1992 and November 2004 were identified from a prospectively collected database. Multiple preoperative and intraoperative variables were examined and their relationship to postoperative outcome was analysed. {RESULTS}: Postoperative mortality was {\textless}1\%. Forty-three patients (43\%) suffered a total of 85 complications. Median length of stay was 12.5 days (range, 1-88 days). The group undergoing {PBD} did not have higher rates of infectious complication (12 vs 19\%; P = 0.34) or overall complication (41 vs 42\%; P = 0.88) compared with the undrained group. Rate of anastomotic leak (18 vs 4\%; P = 0.045) and anaemia requiring transfusion (41 vs 9\%; P = 0.001) were significantly higher in the pancreaticojejunostomy group compared with the pancreaticogastrostomy group. Patients over the age of 70 years did not have higher rates of complication (44 vs 41\%, P = 0.5) or postoperative length of stay. {CONCLUSION}: Preoperative biliary drainage was not associated with increased postoperative complications. Pancreaticogastrostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy is a safe and reliable method of reconstruction. Finally, pancreaticoduodenectomy can be carried out with acceptable rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality in selected patients over 70 years of age.},

	abstract = {Objective: The conventional ratio method (milliliters O2 per mass) typically is used to express Vo2 peak. The goal of the current study was to compare Vo2 peak of obese girls with normal-weight girls by ratio and allometric scaling methods. Research Methods and Procedures: We compared Vo2 peak by ratio and allometric methods in 46 obese and 47 normal-weight girls. Indirect calorimetry was used to measure Vo2 peak during either treadmill running or walking. Regression analysis was used to determine coefficients for mass and stature for each group with {ANOVA} used to compare data between groups. Results: The obese girls were taller and had higher values of body fatness (p ≤ 0.05). Absolute Vo2 peak (liters per minute) was similar between groups; however Vo2 peak relative to mass was 50\% lower (p ≤ 0.05) in the obese girls. When Vo2 peak (milliliters per minute per kilogram) and mass were correlated, r = −0.48 was found in the obese group. Allometric scaling of logarithmic transformed stature and mass reduced this to r = −0.002, thus eliminating the bias associated with the ratio method. Adjusting Vo2 peak allometrically scaled for mass, stature, and the combination of mass and stature reduced the difference between groups from 50\% (ratio method) to 10\% to 11\% (p ≤ 0.05) with higher values found in the normal-weight girls. Discussion: These results demonstrate the bias associated with the ratio method when comparing Vo2 peak in obese girls with Vo2 peak in normal-weight girls. Allometric scaling eliminated the bias and thus may reflect a truer comparative response.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijcard.2015.02.018},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Low peak O2 consumption (V˙O2max/kg) has been widely used as an indirect indicator of poor cardiac fitness, and often guides management of patients with severe heart failure ({HF}). We hypothesized that it should be as good an indicator of cardiac dysfunction in obese and non-obese {HF} patients.
{METHODS}: We compared the cardiopulmonary exercise performance and non-invasive hemodynamics of 152 obese ({BMI}{\textgreater}34kg.m(-2)) and 173 non-obese ({BMI}≤32) male {HF} patients in {NYHA} classes {II} and {III}, with reference to 101 healthy male controls. Their physical and cardiac functional reserves were measured during treadmill exercise testing with standard respiratory gas analyses and {CO}2 rebreathing to measure cardiac output non-invasively during peak exercise. Data are given as mean±{SD}.
{RESULTS}: Obese {HF} patients with {BMI} 40.9±7.5kg·m(-2) (age 56.1±14.0years, {NYHA} 2.5±0.5) exercised to acceptable cardiopulmonary limits (peak {RER}=1.07±0.12), and achieved a mean V˙O2max/kg of 18.6±5.2ml·kg(-1)·min(-1), significantly lower than in non-obese {HF} counterparts (19.9±5.6ml·kg(-1)·min(-1), P=0.02, age 55.8±10.6years, {BMI} 26.6±3.1, {NYHA} 2.4±0.5, peak {RER}=1.07±0.09), with both lower than controls (38.5±9.7ml·kg(-1)·min(-1), P{\textless}10(-6)). In contrast, the uncorrected V˙O2max was higher in obese (2.31±0.69ml·min(-1)) than non-obese {HF} patients (1.61±0.49ml·min(-1), P{\textless}10(-6)). When cardiac dysfunction was evaluated directly, peak cardiac power was significantly greater in obese than non-obese {HF} patients (4.11±1.21W vs 2.73±0.82W, P{\textless}10(-6)), with both lower than controls (5.42±1.04W, P{\textless}10(-6)).
{CONCLUSION}: These results demonstrate that V˙O2max/kg is not a generally reliable indicator of cardiac fitness in all patients. Instead, we found that despite having lower V˙O2max/kg, obese {HF} patients had stronger hearts capable of generating greater cardiac power than non-obese {HF} patients of equivalent clinical {HF} status.},

The data on all of the patients were analyzed retrospectively to identify the factors that might significantly affect the postoperative mortality and morbidity. {RESULTS}: There were no cases of in-hospital mortality or postoperative liver failure. Major complications were encountered in 7 patients (6.9\%), and the overall morbidity rate was 50\%. Reoperation was required in 2 patients (2\%). The overall median length of postoperative hospital stay was 26 days (range, 13-119 days). Univariate analysis in relation to the postoperative morbidity showed significant differences in the preoperative occurrence of segmental cholangitis or cholecystitis (P = 0.015), the severity of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia (P {\textless} 0.001), and the total amount of fresh frozen plasma administered (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed a single independent significant predictive factor for postoperative morbidity, namely, preoperative cholangitis or cholecystitis (odds ratio, 9.08; 95\% confidence interval, 1.05-78.56, P = 0.045). {CONCLUSIONS}: Our experience indicates that hepatobiliary resections for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma can be conducted safely, without a single case of postoperative liver failure or mortality.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Aerobic fitness is an important predictor of postoperative outcome in major surgery. In this study, we assess the effects of a period of preoperative exercise on aerobic fitness as measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) in patients scheduled for abdominal aortic aneurysm ({AAA}) repair.
{METHODS}: As part of a randomized trial, the first patients recruited in the intervention group were enrolled in a supervised exercise program of six week duration. Treadmill {CPET} parameters were measured before and after exercise preoperatively for these patients. These parameters were as follows: peak oxygen uptake ({VO}2 peak), anaerobic threshold ({AT}), and ventilator equivalents for oxygen and carbon dioxide ({VE}/{VO}2 and {VE}/{VCO}2, respectively). Total exercise time and the time at which {AT} was achieved were also recorded. A comparison between pre- and postexercise parameters was made to detect for a possible improvement in aerobic fitness.
{RESULTS}: Twenty patients with {AAA} (17 men; mean age: 74.9 ± 5.9 years) were included in this study. Thirty-five percent of patients had a history of ischemic heart disease, 25\% of obstructive airway disease, and 15\% of cerebral vascular events. Seventy percent were previous smokers, and 15\% were current smokers. Fifty-five percent of patients were taking aspirin and 75\% were undergoing statin therapy. The median (interquartile range) {VO}2 peak at baseline was 18.2 (15.4-19.9) {mL}/kg/min, and after exercise was 19.9 (17.1-21.1; P = 0.048). Median {AT} at baseline was 12.2 (10.5-14.9), and 14.4 (12.3-15.4) after exercise (P = 0.023). Time of exercise tolerated also improved from a median of 379 to 604 sec (P = 0.001). No significant changes were seen in {VE}/{VO}2, {VE}/{VCO}2, or the time at which {AT} was achieved.
{CONCLUSION}: This study shows that cardiopulmonary aerobic fitness improves after a period of supervised exercise in patients scheduled for {AAA} repair. This is justification for a randomized trial to assess whether this affects morbidity and mortality after {AAA} repair.},

	abstract = {Traditional algorithms suggest a stepwise approach to the functional evaluation of candidates for lung resection. A cardiopulmonary exercise test is incorporated as a supplementary test for patients with borderline pulmonary predicted values, and sometimes as a first screening test for cardiac risk evaluation. To assess the predictive weight of exercise tests in noncardiac thoracic surgery, we retrospectively analyzed 99 patients (80 males) aged 67.8 +/-8.1 years who underwent lung resection after a cardiopulmonary exercise test. During basal spirometry, the mean predicted forced expiratory volume in the first second was 69.9\% +/-18.6\%, and predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity was 71.6\% +/-20.5\%. Peak oxygen consumption was 11.1 +/-3.2 {mL}.kg(-1).min(-1), oxygen pulse was 9 +/-2.8 {mL}.beat(-1), and minute ventilation/{CO}(2) output was 45.2 +/- 7.7. Mean hospital stay was 10.4 days, and intensive care unit stay was 0.3 days. Postoperative complications occurred in 20 (20\%) patients.

	abstract = {How common is pancreatic cancer? Pancreatic cancer is the tenth most common cancer in the {UK}. Around 8,100 people were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2008 in the {UK}, that’s around 22 people every day. Pancreatic cancer is the eleventh most common cancer in men, with around 4,000 new cases diagnosed in 2008 in the {UK}. Around 4,100 women were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the {UK} in 2008, making it the eighth most common cancer in women. More than 8 in 10 cases of pancreatic cancer occur in people aged 60 and over. Pancreatic cancer rates for men declined slightly between the late 1970s and mid-1990s, and since then have remained stable. Pancreatic cancer rates for women declined between the late 1980s and late 1990s, but since then have gradually increased. Worldwide, around 279,000 people were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2008. How many people survive pancreatic cancer? Overall, pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis. By the time someone has symptoms, goes to their doctor and is diagnosed, the disease is very often quite advanced. The one-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer has more than doubled since the 1970s, however the rate is still low with only around 16-17\% of patients surviving their disease. Younger pancreatic cancer patients have better survival rates than older patients. Around 3\% of pancreatic cancer patients survive the disease for five years or more. How many people die from pancreatic cancer? Pancreatic cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the {UK}. About 8,000 people in the {UK} died from pancreatic cancer in 2009 in the {UK}, that's around 22 people every day. Worldwide, around 266,000 people died from pancreatic cancer in 2008. Read more in depth {UK} pancreatic cancer mortality statistics. What causes pancreatic cancer? More than 1 in 4 pancreatic cancers in the {UK} are caused by smoking. People with type I or {II} diabetes have roughly twice the risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) is associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Obesity increases the risk of pancreatic cancer. Eating processed meat may increase risk of pancreatic cancer. People with a family history of pancreatic cancer have a higher risk of developing the disease},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer progression and survival is dependent on complex interactions between the tumour and the host. The pronounced local inflammatory response in and around the tumour is thought to represent the in situ host anti-tumour immune response. Since early reports, 40 years ago, there has been a continuing interest in establishing the cellular composition of immune cell infiltrates and their relationship with survival in colorectal cancer. In this review, we comprehensively examine the evidence for the local inflammatory cell reaction/in  situ immune response in predicting outcome in primary operable colorectal cancer  and make recommendations as to how such information may be incorporated into routine clinical assessment. Generally, an increasing number/density of immune cells in and around the tumour is associated with improved outcome in over 100 studies. Whilst the prognostic value of a generalized lymphocytic infiltrate or non-specific peritumoural inflammatory response is strongly related to survival based on 40 different studies, it is also apparent that most individual immune cell types relate to recurrence and cancer specific survival. The evidence is particularly robust for tumour infiltrating T lymphocytes and their subsets ({CD}3+, {CD}8+, {CD}45RO+, {FOXP}3+) in addition to tumour associated macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils. Taken together, the evidence suggests both adaptive and innate anti-tumour immune responses play key roles in determining cancer progression. In order to establish routine clinical utility there is a need to rationalise this prognostic information, published over a 40 years period, into a standardized assessment of tumour inflammatory cell infiltrate. Such standardization may also guide development of novel therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: It has been reported that although young patients present with more advanced disease, when adjusted for stage, cancer-specific survival is not different after surgery for colorectal cancer. However, few studies have examined non-cancer survival in young patients and 10-year survival has rarely been reported. Moreover, the largest study included patients of old age as a comparator. The aim of this study was to compare cancer-specific and non-cancer-related survival at 10 years in a young age cohort and a middle age cohort in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. {METHODS}: Two thousand and seventy seven patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer between 1991 and 1994 in 11 hospitals in Scotland were included in the study. Ten-year cancer-specific and non-cancer-related survival and the hazard ratios ({HR}) were calculated according to age groups ({\textless}45/45-54/55-64/65-74 years). {RESULTS}: On follow-up, 1066 patients died of their cancer and 369 died of non-cancer-related causes. At 10 years, overall survival was 32\%, cancer-specific was 45\%, and non-cancer-related survival was 72\%. On multivariate analysis of all factors, sex ({HR} 0.77, 95\% {CI} 0.68-0.88, P{\textless}0.001), mode of presentation ({HR} 1.64, 95\% {CI} 1.44-1.87, P{\textless}0.01), Dukes' stage ({HR} 2.69, 95\% {CI} 2.49-2.90, P{\textless}0.001), and specialisation ({HR} 1.24, 95\% {CI} 1.04-1.44, P{\textless}0.01) were independently associated  with cancer-specific survival.

Our objective was to evaluate clinically accessible methods to achieve practical and precise measures of body composition in cancer patients. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ({DXA})-based analysis of fat and fat-free mass was performed in 50 cancer patients and compared with bioelectrical impedance analysis ({BIA}) and with regional computed tomography ({CT}) images available in the patients' medical records. {BIA} overestimated or underestimated fat-free mass substantially compared with {DXA} as the method of reference (up to 9.3 kg difference). Significant changes in fat-free mass over time detected with {DXA} in a subset of 21 patients (+2.2 +/- 3.2\%/100 days, p = 0.003), was beyond the limits of detection of {BIA}. Regional analysis of fat and fat-free tissue at the 3rd lumbar vertebra with either {DXA} or {CT} strongly predicted whole-body fat and fat-free mass (r = 0.86-0.94; p {\textless} 0.001). {CT} images provided detail on specific muscles, adipose tissues and organs, not provided by {DXA} or {BIA}. {CT} presents great practical significance due to the prevalence of these images in patient diagnosis and follow-up, thus marrying clinical accessibility with high precision to quantify specific tissues and to predict whole-body composition.},

	abstract = {The two most widely used experimental models of advanced liver disease are the administration of carbon tetrachloride, and common bile duct ligation ({BDL}), however, neither has been systematically evaluated as a model of hepatorenal syndrome ({HRS}). The {BDL} model in rats, studied at diverse time points, induced a progressive renal dysfunction without structural changes in the kidney. The authors concluded that {BDL} is a good model for further studies of {HRS} and its treatment. However, the renal impairment observed at the acute phase of the {BDL} model is based on a different pathophysiology than that of {HRS}. Specifically, in acute obstructive jaundice, cholemia predominates over parenchymal liver disease (reversible at this stage without portal hypertension or cirrhosis) and independently induces negative inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, impaired sympathetic vasoconstriction response and profound natriuresis and diuresis that might lead to volume depletion. In addition, systemic endotoxemia contributes to the prerenal etiology of renal impairment and promotes direct nephrotoxicity and acute tubular necrosis. On the other hand, the renal failure observed in the chronic {BDL} model (with development of biliary cirrhosis, portal hypertension and ascites) shares pathophysiological similarities with {HRS}, but the accordance of the chronic {BDL} model to the diagnostic criteria of {HRS} (e.g. absence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, no renal function improvement after plasma volume expansion) should have been confirmed. In conclusion, we think that the {BDL} model is not suitable for the study of the natural history of {HRS}, but the chronic {BDL} model might be valid for the study of established {HRS} and its potential therapies.},

The evidence-based literature concerning four different areas of pancreatobiliary diseases have been reviewed. Preoperative endoscopic biliary drainage in patients with obstructive jaundice should not be used routinely but only in selected patients. For patients with biliary leakage and bile duct strictures after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, endoscopic stent therapy might be first choice and surgery should be used for failures of endoscopic treatment. Surgery is the treatment of choice after transection of the bile duct (the major bile duct injuries). The majority of patients with obstructive jaundice due to advanced pancreatic cancer will undergo endoscopic drainage but for relatively fit patients with a prognosis of more than 6 months, surgical drainage or even palliative resection might be considered. For patients with persistent pain due to chronic pancreatitis surgical drainage combined with limited pancreatic head resection might be first choice for pain relief. Most importantly, the management of patients with these pancreatobiliary diseases should be performed by a multidisciplinary {HPB} approach and teamwork consisting of gastroenterologists, radiologists and surgeons.},

The importance of this issue rests on whether these postoperative complications are detrimental enough to not recommend preoperative chemoradiation in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. {OBJECTIVE}: This study is in two parts: 1) a retrospective review of patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at Henry Ford Hospital; and 2) a meta-analysis of published studies on the effects of preoperative biliary stents. {METHODS}: In the retrospective portion, all patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy from January 1st, 1997 through December 31st, 2006 were included in the study. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Data gathered included gender, age, pathologic diagnosis, use of preoperative biliary stent (either {ERCP} or {PTC}), all postoperative complications, and in-hospital mortality. In the meta-analysis portion, all studies published from 1990 with either a randomized or quasi-randomized allocation of patients were included. Endpoints analysis were peri-operative mortality, wound infection rate, intra-abdominal abscess rate, and overall morbidity rate. {RESULTS}: In the retrospective portion, 181 patients were studied, with 123 (68.0\%) of these having preoperative biliary stents. Patients with and without stents had no significant difference in wound infection rate (19.5\% vs. 17.2\%, respectively), intra-abdominal abscess rate (16.3\% vs. 22.4\%), any postoperative complication (50.4\% vs. 51.7\%) and in-hospital death (2.4\% vs. 1.7\%). Fifteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. There was variation in both the definitions of complications as well as the incidence of all postoperative endpoints among the studies. For peri-operative mortality and wound infection rate, the relative difference favored the no stent group by 0.5\% (95\% confidence interval: -0.4\% to 1.4\%) and 5.8\% (95\% confidence interval: 3.6\% to 8.0\%), respectively. For intra-abdominal abscess and overall morbidity rate, the relative difference favored the stent group by 2.0\% (95\% confidence interval: -0.3\% to 4.3\%) and 0.06\% (95\% confidence interval -3.8\% to 3.9\%), respectively. {CONCLUSION}: Although the use of a preoperative biliary stent increases the postoperative wound infection rate by about 5\%, there is no overwhelming evidence that it either promotes or protects from the other complications. As there was variation in the definitions used in these studies, a more uniformed system of complication reporting is required.},

	doi = {10.1245/s10434-014-4065-z},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: There is increasing evidence that C-reactive protein is a useful negative predictor of infective complications and anastomotic leak following surgery for colorectal cancer. In particular, C-reactive protein concentrations on postoperative days 3 and 4 have been proposed to be of clinical utility since  they aid safe and early discharge of selected patients following colorectal surgery. However, it is not clear whether such thresholds are also applicable in  laparoscopic surgery. The aim of the present study was to compare the value of daily C-reactive protein concentrations in the prediction of postoperative infective complications in patients undergoing open versus laparoscopic resection for colon cancer. {METHODS}: Patients with histologically proven colon cancer who were considered to have undergone potentially curative resection in one of two university teaching hospitals in Glasgow were included in the study (n = 344). Patient characteristics were collected in a prospective surgical database. All resections were elective cases and were performed using either open (n = 191) or  laparoscopic surgery (n = 153). Daily blood samples to measure C-reactive protein concentrations perioperatively were taken routinely. Patients were assessed for postoperative infective and non-infective complications. {RESULTS}: The majority of patients were aged 65 years or older (75\%), male (52\%), had left-sided tumors (54\%), node negative disease (77\%), and did not undergo neoadjuvant treatment (94\%). Patients undergoing open and laparoscopic resection were similar in terms  of age, sex, tumor site, {TNM} stage, comorbidity, and infective complications. In  contrast, preoperative and postoperative days 1-3 C-reactive protein concentrations were lower following laparoscopic compared with open resection in  the whole cohort (n = 344; all p {\textless} 0.001) and in those who did not develop infective complications (n = 251; all p {\textless} 0.001). The median length of hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic resection (p {\textless} 0.001). During follow-up, 127 (37\%) patients developed a postoperative complication, 93 (73\%) of which were infective complications. In those who developed an infective complication, there  was no significant difference in the C-reactive protein concentrations between open and laparoscopic resections on postoperative days 1-4. C-reactive protein thresholds predictive of infective complications were the same on postoperative days 3 (180 mg/l) and 4 (140 mg/l) following both open and laparoscopic resection for colon cancer. {CONCLUSIONS}: The results of the present study show that although the magnitude of the systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The average weight-losing pancreatic cancer patient undergoing palliative therapy is frequently overweight rather than underweight, and this can confound conventional measures used for risk stratification. The aim of this study was to evaluate if weight and body composition, specifically sarcopenia, assessed from diagnostic computed tomography ({CT}) scans, is of prognostic value in patients with pancreatic cancer. The nature and extent of tissue loss over subsequent months was also evaluated.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: A total of 111 patients entering a palliative therapy program, who had {CT} images and had undergone nutritional screening, were studied. In patients for whom follow-up scans were available (n = 44), longitudinal changes in body composition were studied at a mean of 230 +/- 62 and 95 +/- 60 days prior to demise.
{RESULTS}: Sixty-two patients (55.9\%) were sarcopenic, 44 (39.6\%) were overweight/obese, and 18 (16.2\%) were both. Age {\textgreater} or =59 years (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95\% confidence interval, 1.10-2.66; P = 0.018), and overweight/obese sarcopenia (hazard ratio, 2.07; 95\% confidence interval, 1.23-3.50; P = 0.006) were identified as independent predictors of survival on multivariate analysis. Longitudinal analysis revealed that total fat-free mass index decreased from 15.5 +/- 2.5 kg/m(2) to 14.5 +/- 2.0 kg/m2 (P = 0.002), and total fat mass index decreased from 7.5 +/- 2.0kg/m2 to 6.0 +/- 1.5kg/m2 (P {\textless} 0.0001) over 135 days.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Sarcopenia in overweight/obese patients with advanced pancreatic cancer is an occult condition but can be identified using {CT} scans.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Although some retrospective studies of extended radical lymphadenectomy for pancreatic cancer have suggested a survival advantage, this is controversial.
{METHODS}: A literature search identified randomized controlled trials comparing extended with standard lymphadenectomy in pancreatic cancer surgery. Overall survival was analysed using hazard ratios and standard errors. Pooled estimates of overall treatment effects were calculated using a random effects model (odds ratio and 95 per cent confidence interval).
{RESULTS}: Of four randomized trials identified for systematic review, three were included in a meta-analysis of survival. The log hazard ratios (standard errors) for survival for the three trials were 0.36 (0.22), - 0.15 (0.17) and - 0.21 (0.15); the weighted mean log hazard ratio for survival overall was 0.93 (95 per cent confidence interval 0.77 to 1.13), revealing no significant differences between the standard and extended procedure (P = 0.480). Morbidity and mortality rates were also comparable, with a trend towards higher rates of delayed gastric emptying for extended lymphadenectomy. The number of resected lymph nodes was significantly higher in the extended lymphadenectomy groups (P {\textless} 0.001).
{CONCLUSION}: The extended procedure does not benefit overall survival, and there may even be a trend towards increased morbidity. Therefore extended lymphadenectomy should be performed only within adequately powered controlled trials, if at all.},

	abstract = {The maximal oxygen intake (Max Vo2) was determined in 46 healthy male students and 13 soldiers along with the weight of body fat as estimated by immersion densitometry. In 41 the active tissue and cell mass were estimated from measurements of blood volume, thiocyanate space and antipyrine space. The correlation coefficients between Max Vo2 and a) fat-free body weight, b) active tissue, c) body weight and d) cell mass were found to be 0.85, 0.91, 0.63 and 0.45, respectively. Max Vo2 was related to blood volume and red cell volume by correlation coefficients of 0.78 and 0.69 which was shown to be dependent on relationship between fat-free weight and blood volume (r = 0.76). It was shown that students who participated in athletics had a significantly larger Max Vo2 per kilogram of fat-free body weight than the sedentary group. The largest values occurred in cross-country runners. The sedentary students who did not take part in athletics were divided into three groups according to their body composition, i.e. more than 25\% fat, 10–25\% fat and less than 10\% fat. It was shown that there was no difference in Max Vo2 per kilogram of fat-free weight in the three groups. It is concluded that when Vo2 is used to examine the capacity to perform exhausting work the values should be expressed as Vo2 per kilogram of body weight; that when the test is used to examine the performance of the respiratory-cardiovascular system, the values should be expressed as Vo2 per kilogram of fat-free weight. It is also concluded that physical conditioning affects the maximum Vo2 independently of the mass of active tissue and that obesity per se has no effect on the maximal performance of the respiratory-cardiovascular system in young men.

Tumour necrosis factor alpha ({TNF}-alpha) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of these complications. {AIMS}: To determine the effect of biliary drainage on plasma concentrations of {TNF}-alpha, its soluble circulating receptors ({sTNFr}), and other proinflammatory cytokines. {METHODS}: Plasma concentrations of {TNF}-alpha, {sTNFr}-P75, interleukin 6 ({IL}-6), and {IL}-1 alpha were measured in 25 patients with malignant bile duct obstruction before and after endoscopic stent insertion. {RESULTS}: Mean serum bilirubin was 157 mumol/l before stent insertion and 35.2 mumol/l one week post stent insertion. There was complete relief of jaundice in 77\% of patients by four weeks. Plasma concentrations of {TNF}-alpha and {IL}-1 alpha were below the detection limit of the assays in all samples. Median plasma {sTNFr}-P75 in the cancer patients was 960 ng/l (range 400-6600), before stent insertion and remained unchanged at one and four weeks after stenting. Plasma {sTNFr}-P75 in cancer patients was significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.01) than in healthy controls (250 (200-650) ng/l). Before stent insertion, plasma {IL}-6 concentrations were detectable (above 5 ng/l) in 17 (68\%) patients. After relief of biliary obstruction {IL}-6 levels fell from a prestent median of 13.2 to less than 5 ng/l at one week after stent insertion. Plasma concentrations of {IL}-6 were undetectable in 76\% of patients at this time. {CONCLUSION}: Activation of the {TNF}/{sTNFr} complex is unchanged after biliary drainage in patients with malignant bile duct obstruction.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Morbidity and mortality are higher in patients with poor preoperative cardiorespiratory reserve. This study aimed to ascertain fitness and therefore risk in elective patients, comparing three measures: Duke Activity Status Index ({DASI}) questionnaire, incremental shuttle walk test ({ISWT}), and cycle cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}). We looked for correlation between the measures and for thresholds on the questionnaire or shuttle test which could identify fit patients and render {CPET} unnecessary. {METHODS}: A prospective cohort trial of 50 patients having intra-abdominal surgery. Each performed {DASI}, {ISWT}, and {CPET} during a single visit to the hospital. {RESULTS}: There was a significant correlation between measured oxygen consumption and both {ISWT} and {DASI}. Receiver operator curve showed both the shuttle walk test and the {DASI} are sensitive and specific predictors of {VO}(2)peak {\textgreater}15 ml O(2) kg(-1) min(-1) and anaerobic threshold ({AT}) {\textgreater}11 ml O(2) kg(-1) min(-1). Thirty-two patients would be considered lower risk, having achieved both {VO}(2)peak and {AT} cut-offs. Setting an {ISWT} threshold of 360 m identified 13 of the lower risk patients [positive predictive value ({PPV}) 1.0, negative predictive value ({NPV}) 0.49]. Setting a {DASI} threshold score of 46 identified nine lower risk patients ({PPV} 1.0, {NPV} 0.44). {CONCLUSIONS}: We found a significant correlation between the tests. However, many patients with poor questionnaire scores or shuttle walks had satisfactory {CPET} results. Hence, the ability of either simple test to determine risk in a heterogeneous surgical population is poor. {CPET} provides an objective measurement of cardiopulmonary fitness; however, evidence for this information improving patient outcome is limited and requires further research.},

	abstract = {Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is made late, and prognosis remains extremely poor. This study was carried out to investigate whether symptoms exist before pain or jaundice that could suggest pancreatic cancer and favor earlier diagnosis. The study involved 305 patients with confirmed pancreatic cancer and 305 controls. All subjects were interviewed personally at least twice about their clinical history; pancreatic cancer patients were asked about any disturbances before abdominal pain or jaundice. Of the 305 pancreatic cancer patients, 151 (49.5\%) had some prior disturbances, 108 (35.4\%) 6 months or less before pain or jaundice and 43 (14.1\%) more than 6 months before. Among the latter, 14 (4.6\% of all patients) had had anorexia and/or early satiety and/or asthenia (7-20 months before pain or jaundice), 11 (3.6\%) had disgust for coffee and/or smoking and/or wine (7-20 months before), 14 (4.6\%) had diabetes (7-24 months before), and four (1.3\%) had acute pancreatitis (8-26 months before). Among the controls, the only reports of these symptoms were two (0.7\%) cases of asthenia (4 and 6 years earlier), 22 (7.2\%) cases of diabetes (of which only two [0.7\%] were diagnosed 7-24 months before the interview), and one (0.33\%) case of acute pancreatitis (10 years earlier). Apart from acute pancreatitis, all the other differences between patients and controls were statistically significant. In approximately 15\% of patients, disturbances existed more than 6 months before pain or jaundice, which, although not specific, could raise suspicion of the possibility of pancreatic cancer. These disturbances could represent the one current opportunity for an earlier diagnosis in a significant minority of pancreatic cancer patients.},

This study demonstrated that surgical stress rapidly depressed monocyte {mCD}14 and {HLA}-{DR} expression in comparison with preanesthesia levels. Monocyte {mCD}14 expression recovered to preoperative levels on the first postoperative day, and monocyte {HLA}-{DR} expression recovered by the seventh postoperative day. Consistent with our previous study, {LPS}-induced tumor necrosis factor ({TNF})-alpha production ex vivo was significantly suppressed from the beginning of the operation. On the contrary, the plasma interleukin-10 concentration started to increase after the surgical incision was made. {LPS} hyporesponsiveness was least at the end of the operation and returned to preoperative levels on the first postoperative day. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that {LPS} responsiveness, plasma interleukin-10 concentration, and monocytes {mCD}14 and {HLA}-{DR} expression altered from the early period of surgery. These alterations may be related to the impairment of the immune system during the perioperative period.
{IMPLICATIONS}: Recent studies demonstrate that surgical stress induces immune dysfunction. We found that surgical stress rapidly decreased monocyte {mCD}14 and human leukocyte antigen-{DR} expression, and endotoxin responsiveness. These findings suggest that early changes of the immune system caused by surgical stress contribute to postoperative complications such as sepsis and multiple organ failure.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ejso.2014.03.010},
	abstract = {{AbstractBackground}
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy ({NAC}) followed by surgery for resectable oesophageal or gastric cancer improves outcome when compared with surgery alone. However {NAC} has adverse effects. We assess here whether {NAC} adversely affects physical fitness and whether such an effect is associated with impaired survival following surgery.
Methods
We prospectively studied 116 patients with oesophageal or gastric cancer to assess the effect of {NAC} on physical fitness, of whom 89 underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) before {NAC} and proceeded to surgery. 39 patients were tested after all cycles of {NAC} but prior to surgery. Physical fitness was assessed by measuring oxygen uptake ( V ˙ O 2 in ml kg−1 min−1) at the estimated lactate threshold ( θ ˆ L ) and at peak exercise ( V ˙ O 2 peak in ml kg−1 min−1).
Results
V ˙ O 2 at θ ˆ L and at peak were significantly lower after {NAC} compared to pre-{NAC} values: V ˙ O 2 at θ ˆ L 14.5 ± 3.8 (baseline) vs. 12.3 ± 3.0 (post-{NAC}) ml kg−1 min−1; p ≤ 0.001; V ˙ O 2 peak 20.8 ± 6.0 vs. 18.3 ± 5.1 ml kg−1 min−1; p ≤ 0.001; absolute V ˙ O 2 (ml min−1) at θ ˆ L and peak were also lower post-{NAC}; p ≤ 0.001. Decreased baseline V ˙ O 2 at θ ˆ L and peak were associated with increased one year mortality in patients who completed a full course of {NAC} and had surgery; p = 0.014.
Conclusion
{NAC} before cancer surgery significantly reduced physical fitness in the overall cohort. Lower baseline fitness was associated with reduced one-year-survival in patients completing {NAC} and surgery, but not in patients who did not complete {NAC}. It is possible that in some patients the harms of {NAC} may outweigh the benefits.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: A selective combination of C-reactive protein and albumin (termed the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score, {mGPS}) has been shown to have prognostic value, independent of tumour stage, in lung, gastrointestinal and renal cancers.  It is also of interest that liver function tests such as bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, as well as serum calcium, have also been reported to predict cancer survival. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between an inflammation-based prognostic score ({mGPS}), biochemical parameters, tumour site and survival in a large cohort of patients with cancer. {METHODS}: Patients (n=21,669) who had an incidental blood sample taken between 2000 and 2006 for C-reactive protein, albumin and calcium (and liver function tests where available) and a diagnosis of cancer were identified.  Of this group 9608 patients who had an ongoing malignant process were studied (sampled within 2 years before diagnosis). Also a subgroup of 5397 sampled at the time of diagnosis (sampled within 2 months prior to diagnosis) were examined. Cancers were grouped by tumour site in accordance with International Classification of Diseases 10 ({ICD} 10). {RESULTS}: On follow up, there were 6005 (63\%) deaths of which 5122 (53\%) were cancer deaths. The median time from blood sampling to diagnosis was 1.4 months. Increasing age, male gender and increasing  deprivation was associated with a reduced 5-year overall and cancer-specific survival (all P{\textless}0.001). An elevated {mGPS}, adjusted calcium, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and gamma-glutamyl transferase were associated with a reduced 5-year overall and cancer-specific survival (independent of age, sex and deprivation in all patients sampled), as well as within the time of diagnosis subgroup (all P{\textless}0.001). An increasing {mGPS} was predictive of a reduced cancer-specific survival in all cancers (all P{\textless}0.001). {CONCLUSION}: The results of the present study indicate that the {mGPS} is  a powerful prognostic factor when compared with other biochemical parameters and  independent of tumour site in patients with cancer.},

A systematic review of data published from 1964 to 2012 was undertaken according to a pre-defined protocol. There is robust evidence that general {LBVI} and {LVI} are independent prognostic factors of poorer survival. The prognostic role of {BVI} remains unclear. Most studies detected {LBVI} using H\&E stained sections. The overall weighted average of the {LBVI} rate using immunostaining was higher (35\%) than H\&E (24\%). The {LBVI} rate using H\&E was variable (9-50\%) and less variable using immunostaining (32-41\%).

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) assessed “poorer” fitness correlates with poorer outcomes in blinded studies. Whether this correlation will persist when {CPET} is utilized to stratify care as part of a multi-modal enhanced recovery after surgery ({ERAS}) program is unclear. This study examined whether {CPET} variables were associated with postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing hepatectomy within an {ERAS} program.


Objectives and Methods

Data were prospectively collected on patients undergoing elective hepatectomy between October 2009 and April 2011. The relationships between {CPET} derived variables; postoperative complications and length of stay were investigated.


Results

Of 267 patients undergoing surgery, 197 had undergone standard cycle ergometer {CPET}. The relative oxygen uptake [{VO}2 (ml kg−1 min−1)] and ventilatory equivalent of {CO}2 ({VE}/{VCO}2) at the anaerobic threshold ({AT}) were not associated with complications or length of stay. Greater absolute oxygen uptake at {AT} [{VO}2 at {AT} (L min−1)] was associated with early hospital discharge [{OR} 2.16 (95\% {CI} 1.18–3.96), P = 0.013] on multivariable analysis.


Conclusions

When {CPET} is used to delineate perioperative management a low relative oxygen uptake [{VO}2 (ml kg−1 min−1)] at the {AT} does not place patients at significantly higher risk of postoperative complications. This suggests {CPET} assessed “poor” fitness should not be used as a barrier to surgical intervention. J. Surg. Oncol. 2014; 110:439–444. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Specifically, in colorectal cancer, an elevated {mGPS} and {PI} were predictive of a  reduced cancer specific survival independent of age, sex, deprivation and tumour  stage (both p{\textless}0.001). {CONCLUSION}: The results of the present study show that systemic inflammation-based scores, in particular the {mGPS} and {PI}, have prognostic value in cancer independent of tumour site. Based on the present results and the existing validation literature, the {mGPS} should be included in the routine assessment of all patients with cancer.},

	abstract = {Objective
To perform a systematic review of cardiopulmonary exercise testing ({CPET}) in the pre-operative evaluation of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm or peripheral vascular disease requiring surgery.
Methods
Review methods and reporting were according to the {PRISMA} guidelines. Studies were eligible if they reported {CPET}-derived physiological parameters in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair or lower extremity arterial bypass. Data were extracted regarding patient populations and correlation between {CPET} and surgical outcomes including mortality, morbidity, critical care bed usage and length of hospital stay.
Results
The searches identified 1301 articles. Although 53 abstracts referred to the index vascular procedures, only seven articles met inclusion criteria. There were no data from randomised controlled trials. Data from prospective studies did not comprehensively correlate {CPET} and surgical outcomes in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. There were no studies reporting {CPET} in patients undergoing lower extremity arterial bypass. Major limitations included small sample sizes, lack of blinding, and an absence of reporting standards.
Conclusion
The paucity of robust data precludes routine adoption of {CPET} in risk stratifying patients undergoing major vascular surgery. The use of {CPET} should be restricted to clinical trials and experimental registries, reporting to consensus-defined standards.},

	abstract = {It is generally agreed that there is an increased incidence of postoperative renal failure in patients with obstructive jaundice. The proposition that this may be due to endotoxin, and that the endotoxin may be absorbed from the patient's own bowel flora, has been investigated. The study was conducted in patients and in animals. Twenty-four patients with obstructive jaundice were studied. Sixteen had endotoxin in the portal blood at operation and 13 of these had peripheral endotoxaemia at the time of operation or developed it during the 72 hours following operation. Only 3 of the patients had a proved possible site of infective origin for the endotoxaemia, the remainder absorbing the endotoxin from their own gastro-intestinal organisms. Portal endotoxaemia occurred when the serum bilirubin was 8·5 mg/100 ml or greater. There was a highly significant decrease in mean endogenous creatinine clearance postoperatively in patients with endotoxaemia, and expression of this as a percentage postoperative fall compared with preoperative levels enhanced the significance. Jaundiced patients without endotoxaemia had no significant fall in endogenous creatinine clearance. Matched non-jaundiced control patients did not develop portal or peripheral endotoxaemia, and there was no significant fall in postoperative creatinine clearance. Experiments using animals showed that the absence of bile salts in the intestinal tract in obstructive jaundice allows endotoxin to be absorbed, and that this absorption can be preuented by the oral administration of bile salts. The therapeutic implications in patients are discussed.},

	abstract = {During 2002 the International Association of Pancreatology developed evidenced-based guidelines on the surgical management of acute pancreatitis. There were 11 guidelines, 10 of which were recommendations grade B and one (the second) grade A. (1) Mild acute pancreatitis is not an indication for pancreatic surgery. (2) The use of prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics reduces infection rates in computed tomography-proven necrotizing pancreatitis but may not improve survival. (3) Fine-needle aspiration for bacteriology should be performed to differentiate between sterile and infected pancreatic necrosis in patients with sepsis syndrome. (4) Infected pancreatic necrosis in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of sepsis is an indication for intervention including surgery and radiological drainage. (5) Patients with sterile pancreatic necrosis (with negative fine-needle aspiration for bacteriology) should be managed conservatively and only undergo intervention in selected cases. (6) Early surgery within 14 days after onset of the disease is not recommended in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis unless there are specific indications. (7) Surgical and other forms of interventional management should favor an organ-preserving approach, which involves debridement or necrosectomy combined with a postoperative management concept that maximizes postoperative evacuation of retroperitoneal debris and exudate. (8) Cholecystectomy should be performed to avoid recurrence of gallstone-associated acute pancreatitis. (9) In mild gallstone-associated acute pancreatitis, cholecystectomy should be performed as soon as the patient has recovered and ideally during the same hospital admission. (10) In severe gallstone-associated acute pancreatitis, cholecystectomy should be delayed until there is sufficient resolution of the inflammatory response and clinical recovery. (11) Endoscopic sphincterotomy is an alternative to cholecystectomy in those who are not fit to undergo surgery in order to lower the risk of recurrence of gallstone-associated acute pancreatitis. There is however a theoretical risk of introducing infection into sterile pancreatic necrosis. These guidelines should now form the basis for audit studies in order to determine the quality of patient care delivery.},

	abstract = {Background
Depression has been associated with delayed presentation, inadequate treatment, and poor survival in patients with cancer.

Methods
Using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results and Medicare linked data (1992–2005), we identified patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (N = 23,745). International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, Clinical Modification codes were used to evaluate depression during the 3 to 27 months before the diagnosis of cancer. The effect of depression on receipt of therapy and survival was evaluated in univariate and multivariate models.

Results
Of patients with pancreatic cancer in our study, 7.9\% had a diagnosis of depression (N = 1,868). Depression was associated with increased age, female sex, white race, single or widowed status, and advanced stage disease (P {\textless} .0001). In an adjusted model, patients with locoregional disease and depression had 37\% lower odds of undergoing surgical resection (odds ratio, 0.63; 95\% confidence interval, 0.52–0.76). In patients with locoregional disease, depression was associated with lower 2-year survival (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95\% confidence interval, 1.09–1.32). After adjusting for surgical resection, this association was attenuated (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95\% confidence interval, 1.04–1.26). In patients who underwent surgical resection, depression was a significant predictor of survival (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95\% confidence interval, 1.04–1.73). Patients with distant disease and depression had 21\% lower odds of receiving chemotherapy (odds ratio, 0.79; 95\% confidence interval, 0.70–0.90). After adjusting for chemotherapy for distant disease, depression was no longer a significant predictor of survival (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95\% confidence interval, 0.97–1.09).

Conclusion
The decreased survival associated with depression appears to be mediated by a lower likelihood of appropriate treatment in depressed patients. Accurate recognition and treatment of pancreatic cancer patients with depression may improve treatment rates and survival.},

	abstract = {Since the initial work, a decade ago that the combination of C-reactive protein and albumin, the Glasgow Prognostic Score ({GPS}), had independent prognostic value in patients with cancer, there have been more than 60 studies ({\textgreater}30,000 patients)  that have examined and validated the use of the {GPS} or the modified {GPS} ({mGPS}) in a variety of cancer scenarios. The present review provides a concise overview of  these studies and comments on the current and future clinical utility of this simple objective systemic inflammation-based score. The {GPS}/{mGPS} had independent  prognostic value in (a) unselected cohorts (4 studies, {\textgreater}19,400 patients) (b) operable disease (28 studies, {\textgreater}8,000 patients) (c) chemo/radiotherapy (11 studies, {\textgreater}1500 patients) (d) inoperable disease (11 studies, {\textgreater}2,000 patients). Association studies (15 studies, {\textgreater}2,000 patients) pointed to an increased {GPS}/{mGPS} being associated with increased weight and muscle loss, poor performance status, increased comorbidity, increased pro-inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines and complications on treatment. These studies have originated from 13 different countries, in particular the {UK} and Japan. A chronic systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by the {GPS}/{mGPS}, is clearly implicated in the prognosis of patients with cancer in a variety of clinical scenarios. The {GPS}/{mGPS} is the most extensively validated of the systemic inflammation-based prognostic scores and therefore may be used in the routine clinical assessment of patients with cancer. It not only identifies patients at risk but also provides a well defined therapeutic target for future clinical trials. It remains to be determined whether the {GPS} has prognostic value in other disease states.},

	abstract = {High morbidity and mortality in surgical management for patients with obstructive jaundice was greatly attributed to the metabolic derangements in jaundiced liver mitochondria. Isolated liver mitochondria from jaundiced rat, produced by common bile duct ligation, were used to study the relationship among {NADH} level, oxygen consumption, and extramitochondrial calcium concentration. Alterations in {NADH} percentage and oxygen consumption were accomplished by incubating mitochondria with different substrates and monitoring oxygen consumption and {NAD}(P)H fluorescence simultaneously. In jaundiced liver mitochondria with glutamate + malate as substrate, respiration increased after the addition of exogenous Ca2+ at concentrations of 1 x 10(-7), 5 x 10(-7), and 1 x 10(-6) M. The maximal effect occurred at 5 x 10(-7) M. With different {NADH}-related substrates, the {NAD}(P)H fluorescence measurements (X axis) correlated linearly with state 3 respiration (Y axis), the slopes of the correlation curves being 2.27 and 0.79 in control and jaundiced mitochondria, respectively. After the addition of 5 x 10(-7) M Ca2+, the respirations of both control and jaundiced mitochondria increased and the slope for jaundiced mitochondria rose to 1.67. The matrix free Ca2+ concentration in jaundiced mitochondria, measured by fluo-3 loading, was higher than that in controls (162.1 +/- 16.7 {nM}, vs 129.7 +/- 12.6 {nM}, P {\textless} 0.01), while the matrix free/total Ca2+ ratio decreased from 34.9 +/- 6.0 (x10(-6)) to 27.2 +/- 4.4 (x10(-6), 9- {\textless} 0.05. The amplitude of the change in {NAD}(P)H fluorescence was reduced in jaundiced rat liver mitochondria and this correlated with the depression of respiration.

	abstract = {Hemipancreatoduodenectomy has remained afflicted with high postoperative morbidity rates. Preoperative icterus is considered a significant risk factor. Therefore, a preoperative biliary drainage has been considered a standard preoperative procedure. This study aims to assess the preoperative drainage of the biliary tract significance with respect to the postoperative complications rates. {SUBJECTS} {AND} {METHODOLOGY}: This retrospective study includes 304 patients after completed hemipancreatoduodenectomies, who were operated in the 1st Surgical Clinic of the 1st Medical Faculty of the Charles University and the General Faculty Hospital in Prague between January 1990 and December 2002. In this trial group, 144 patients had underwent preoperative drainage of the biliary ducts and 160 patients underwent surgical procedures without the preoperative drainage. {RESULTS}: In the trial group, no significant difference in the gender rates, the history of the risk factors, the surgical procedure duration, the perioperative blood loss and the disease stage was detected. The patient trial group with the preoperative drainage of the biliary ducts completed was statistically significantly older (p = 0.05), had higher serum bilirubin levels recorded (118, respectively 81, p = 0.01), had more complications recorded postoperatively (42.4\%, respectively 25\%; p = 0.05), and more infectious complications (29\%, respectively 13\%; p = 0.05) when compared with the trial group without the preoperative drainage completed. Upon comparison of the both groups, we have not detected any statistically significant differences regarding the time interval between the diagnosis and the surgical procedure, the hospitalization duration or the mortality rates. {CONCLUSION}: The operated who had had the internal drainage of the biliary ducts conduted preoperatively, suffered from more complications in total as well as from more infectious complications, compared with the patients without the drainage. On the other hand, the patients who had had the preoperative drainage completed were older and had had higher preoperative bilirubin levels. With respect to the above results we strongly advise the patients with the pancreatic head carcinoma to early consult a hepatobiliary surgeon. As far as the examination algorithm is concerned, we strongly recommend using not only the spiral {CT}, but also non-invasive methods of examination (the {MRI} and the {MRI} cholangiography).},

Methods Medical records of patients who underwent {PD} for pancreatic adenocarcinoma at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between 30 August 1993 and 28 February 2005 were reviewed. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to identify predictors of early mortality, defined as death at 9 and 12 months. {EMRS} was constructed from univariate associated risk factors (age {\textgreater}75 years, tumor size ≥3cm, poor differentiation, co-morbid diseases) with each factor assigned 1 point (range of 0-4). {EMRS} was evaluated as an independent predictor of death at 9 and 12 months. Results On univariate analysis, risk factors for death at 9 months included age ≥75 years ({RR}, 1.6; p = .009), comorbid disease ({RR}, 1.5; p = 0.020), tumor ≥3 cm ({RR}, 1.4; P = 0.050), and poor differentiation ({RR}, 2.1; P {\textless} 0.001). {EMRS} was associated with early mortality among those who did (p = 0.038) and did not receive adjuvant treatment (p {\textless} 0.001).

	abstract = {Background
Obesity is generally believed to be a risk factor for the development of postoperative complications. Although being obese is associated with medical hazards, recent literature shows no convincing data to support this assumption. Moreover a paradox between body mass index and survival is described. This study was designed to determine influence of body mass index on postoperative complications and long-term survival after surgery.

Methods
A single-centre prospective analysis of postoperative complications in 4293 patients undergoing general surgery was conducted, with a median follow-up time of 6.3 years. We analyzed the impact of bodyweight on postoperative morbidity and mortality, using univariate and multivariate regression models.

Results
The obese had more concomitant diseases, increased risk of wound infection, greater intraoperative blood loss and a longer operation time. Being underweight was associated with a higher risk of complications, although not significant in adjusted analysis. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that underweight patients had worse outcome ({HR} 2.1; 95 \% {CI} 1.4-3.0), whereas being overweight ({HR} 0.6; 95 \% {CI} 0.5–0.8) or obese ({HR} 0.7; 95 \% {CI} 0.6–0.9) was associated with improved survival.

Conclusion
Obesity alone is a significant risk factor for wound infection, more surgical blood loss and a longer operation time. Being obese is associated with improved long-term survival, validating the obesity paradox. We also found that complication and mortality rates are significantly worse for underweight patients. Our findings suggest that a tendency to regard obesity as a major risk factor in general surgery is not justified. It is the underweight patient who is most at risk of major postoperative complications, including long-term mortality.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}/{AIM}: Patients with obstructive jaundice due to cancer of the pancreatic head often undergo preoperative endoscopic biliary drainage ({EBD}). The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term impact of preoperative {EBD} following pancreaticoduodenectomy ({PD}) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: We studied 106 patients who underwent {PD} for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma between May 2000 and November 2013 at the Jikei University Hospital. We retrospectively examined perioperative findings as predictors of prognosis and the relationship between preoperative {EBD} and recurrence rate as well as overall survival.
{RESULTS}: In univariate analysis, significant factors associated with poor disease-free survival consisted of the presence of {EBD} (p=0.0213), poor tumor differentiation (p=0.0023) and tumor-node-metastasis ({TNM}) classification {IV} (p=0.0027), while significant factors associated with poor overall survival consisted of the presence of {EBD} (p=0.0047), poor tumor differentiation (p{\textless}0.0001), {TNM} classification {IV} (p=0.0031) and microscopic or macroscopic residual tumor (p=0.0184). In multivariate analysis, poor tumor differentiation (p=0.0033) and {TNM} classification {IV} (p=0.0020) were independent factors for poor disease-free survival, while the presence of {EBD} (p=0.0435), poor tumor differentiation (p=0.0009), {TNM} classification {IV} (p=0.0447) and microscopic or macroscopic residual tumor (p=0.0184) were independent factors for poor overall survival.

	url = {http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12297769},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the only potentially curative treatment for peripapillary pancreatic tumors. However, postoperative morbidity and mortality are high, and different approaches have been tried to improve results, such as preoperative biliary drainage in patients with jaundice. This meta-analysis investigated the effect on postoperative outcome of preoperative biliary drainage by endoscopic biliary stent placement in patients who are jaundiced and who have peripapillary pancreatic tumors. {METHODS}: A Medline search for the period 1985 to 2001 was performed. Eight retrospective studies and 2 prospective randomized controlled trials were included. Selection criteria for the primary analysis were as follows: patients with peripapillary pancreatic cancer, endoscopic stent placement versus no stent, radical surgery, and assessment of postoperative morbidity and mortality. A secondary analysis included both radical and palliative surgery. {RESULTS}: In the primary analysis, 337 patients underwent preoperative endoscopic biliary stent placement, and 412 patients had no endoscopic biliary stent placement (controls). The overall odds ratio for postoperative complications (stent vs. no stent) is estimated as 0.79: 95\% {CI} [0.36, 1.73] and the estimated odds ratio for postoperative mortality is 0.81: 95\% {CI} [0.33, 1.99]. In the secondary analysis, 1008 patients underwent preoperative {EBS} versus 720 control patients. The odds ratio for postoperative complications in this analysis was 0.93: 95\% {CI} [0.65, 1.33] and for postoperative mortality is 1.12: 95\% {CI} [0.62, 2.01]. {CONCLUSION}: No evidence was found of either a positive or adverse effect of preoperative endoscopic biliary stent placement on the outcome of surgery in patients with pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To provide health care providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data regarding the use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ({ERCP}) for diagnosis and therapy. {PARTICIPANTS}: A non-Federal, non-advocate, 13-member panel representing the fields of gastroenterology, hepatology, clinical epidemiology, oncology, biostatistics, surgery, health services research, radiology, internal medicine, and the public. In addition, experts in these same fields presented data to the panel and to a conference audience of approximately 300. {EVIDENCE}: Presentations by experts; a systematic review of the medical literature provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; and an extensive bibliography of {ERCP} research papers, prepared by the National Library of Medicine. Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience. {CONFERENCE} {PROCESS}: Answering predefined questions, the panel drafted a statement based on the scientific evidence presented in open forum and the scientific literature. The draft statement was read in its entirety on the final day of the conference and circulated to the experts and the audience for comment. The panel then met in executive session to consider these comments and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The statement was made available on the World Wide Web at http://consensus.nih.gov immediately after the conference. This statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the {NIH} or the Federal Government. {CONCLUSIONS}: In the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ({MRCP}), endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS}), and {ERCP} have comparable sensitivity and specificity. Patients undergoing cholecystectomy do not require {ERCP} preoperatively if there is low probability of having choledocholithiasis. Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration and postoperative {ERCP} are both safe and reliable in clearing common bile duct stones. {ERCP} with endoscopic sphincterotomy ({ES}) and stone removal is a valuable therapeutic modality in choledocholithiasis with jaundice, dilated common bile duct, acute pancreatitis, or cholangitis. In patients with pancreatic or biliary cancer, the principal advantage of {ERCP} is palliation of biliary obstruction when surgery is not elected. In patients who have pancreatic or biliary cancer and who are surgical candidates, there is no established role for preoperative biliary drainage by {ERCP}. Tissue sampling for patients with pancreatic or biliary cancer not undergoing surgery may be achieved by {ERCP}, but this is not always diagnostic. {ERCP} is the best means to diagnose ampullary cancers. {ERCP} has no role in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis except when biliary pancreatitis is suspected. In patients with severe biliary pancreatitis, early intervention with {ERCP} reduces morbidity and mortality compared with delayed {ERCP}. {ERCP} with appropriate therapy is beneficial in selected patients who have either recurrent pancreatitis or pancreatic pseudocysts. Patients with type I sphincter of Oddi dysfunction ({SOD}) respond to endoscopic sphincterotomy ({ES}). Patients with type {II} {SOD} should not undergo diagnostic {ERCP} alone. If sphincter of Oddi manometer pressures are {\textgreater}40 {mmHg}, {ES} is beneficial in some patients. Avoidance of unnecessary {ERCP} is the best way to reduce the number of complications. {ERCP} should be avoided if there is a low likelihood of biliary stone or stricture, especially in women with recurrent pain, a normal bilirubin, and no other objective sign of biliary disease. Endoscopists performing {ERCP} should have appropriate training and expertise before performing advanced procedures. With newer diagnostic imaging technologies emerging, {ERCP} is evolving into a predominantly therapeutic procedure.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Stress testing is frequently used to assess cardiac risk before thoracic surgery. However, the relationship between treadmill exercise capacity and length of stay ({LOS}) has not been investigated. We hypothesized that exercise capacity, a strong predictor of long-term prognosis, can also predict {LOS} after thoracic cancer surgery. {METHODS}: Accordingly, 191 consecutive patients who had exercise stress testing before major thoracic cancer surgery were retrospectively grouped by poor ({\textless}4 metabolic equivalents [{METs}], n = 31), fair (4 to 7 {METs}, n = 107), good (7 to 10 {METs}, n = 30), and excellent ({\textgreater}10 {METs}, n = 23) exercise capacity. The relationship between exercise capacity and {LOS} was then determined. {RESULTS}: Average {LOS} was inversely related to exercise capacity, with a nearly twofold increase in {LOS} between the excellent and poor exercise groups (4.8 versus 9.2 days). This relationship remained significant even after controlling for operation type, history of dyspnea, sex, and smoking history in analysis of covariance. Prolonged hospital stay (10 days or more) was strongly predicted by exercise capacity. Failure to exceed 4 {METs} was associated with a high risk of prolonged stay (9 of 31, 39\%), whereas none of the 23 patients who exceeded 10 {METs} had a prolonged stay. {CONCLUSIONS}: Treadmill exercise capacity has independent predictive value for {LOS} and risk of prolonged stay after thoracic cancer surgery. These findings have important implications for risk assessment and cost, suggesting that preoperative programs designed to improve exercise capacity may favorably influence {LOS} and associated costs.},

	abstract = {In patients with severe acute pancreatitis, the most important diagnostic goal is differentiation between the interstitial-edematous and the necrotizing type of acute pancreatitis. Surgical management in patients with proven necrotizing pancreatitis is indicated in patients who develop surgical acute abdomen, sepsis, shock syndrome, multisystemic organ failure syndrome, persistent or progressive despite maximum intensive care. The most appropriate procedure for surgical management of pancreatic necrosis is the careful removal of necrosis and preservation of vital pancreatic tissue. Necrosectomy supplemented by postoperative closed continuous lavage of the lesser sac is a procedure that offers the advantages of debridement of devitalized tissue only, and the non-surgical removal of necrotic tissue and bacterially and biologically active compounds. In comparison with a reoperation protocol, necrosectomy and continuous lavage reduce the reoperation rate as well as the need for tracheostomy. In a prospectively treated series of patients suffering from necrotizing pancreatitis, hospital mortality was 8.4\% and the reoperation rate 27\%. Any tissue becoming necrotic in the postoperative course of disease is rinsed with lavage fluid, thus obviating the need for repeated surgical reoperation in most patients. Local lavage is achieved by the insertion of two, in some cases five, large double-lumen tubus and the use of 8 liters (median) of lavage fluid per day.},

However, the factors that contribute to the fall in albumin concentrations are not well understood. In the present study, we examined the relationship between circulating albumin concentrations, weight loss, the body cell mass (measured using total body potassium), and the presence of an inflammatory response (measured using C-reactive protein) in male patients (n = 40) with advanced lung or gastrointestinal cancer. Albumin concentrations were significantly correlated with the percent ideal body weight (r = 0.390, p {\textless} 0.05), extent of reported weight loss (r = -0.492, p {\textless} 0.01), percent predicted total body potassium (adjusted for age, height, and weight, r = 0.686, p {\textless} 0.001), and log10 C-reactive protein concentrations (r = -0.545, p {\textless} 0.001). On multiple regression analysis, the percent predicted total body potassium and log10 C-reactive protein concentrations accounted for 63\% of the variation in albumin concentrations (r2 = 0.626, p {\textless} 0.001). The interrelationship between albumin, body cell mass, and the inflammatory response is consistent with the concept that the presence of an ongoing inflammatory response contributes to the  progressive loss of these vital protein components of the body and the subsequent death of patients with advanced cancer.},

	doi = {10.1207/S15327914NC402_7},
	abstract = {Weight loss in advanced cancer patients is refractory to conventional nutritional support. This may be due to metabolic changes mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, hormones, and tumor-derived products. We previously showed that a nutritional supplement enriched with fish oil will reverse weight loss in patients with pancreatic cancer cachexia. The present study examines the effect of this supplement on a number of mediators thought to play a role in cancer cachexia. Twenty weight-losing patients with pancreatic cancer were asked to consume a nutritional supplement providing 600 kcal and 2 g of eicosapentaenoic acid per day. At baseline and after 3 wk, patients were weighed and samples were  collected to measure serum concentrations of interleukin ({IL})-6 and its soluble receptor tumor necrosis factor receptors I and {II}, cortisol, insulin, and leptin, peripheral blood mononuclear cell production of {IL}-1 beta, {IL}-6, and tumor necrosis factor, and urinary excretion of proteolysis inducing factor. After 3 wk of consumption of the fish oil-enriched nutritional supplement, there was a significant fall in production of {IL}-6 (from median 16.5 to 13.7 ng/ml, P = 0.015), a rise in serum insulin concentration (from 3.3 to 5.0 {mU}/l, P = 0.0064), a fall in the cortisol-to-insulin ratio (P = 0.0084), and a fall in the proportion of patients excreting proteolysis inducing factor (from 88\% to 40\%, P  = 0.008). These changes occurred in association with weight gain (median 1 kg, P  = 0.024). Various mediators of catabolism in cachexia are modulated by administration of a fish oil-enriched nutritional supplement in pancreatic cancer patients. This may account for the reversal of weight loss in patients consuming  this supplement.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Surgery is essential to any curative plan for lung cancer, but is associated with a high complication rate. We sought to determine the impact of complications on long-term survival after a curative surgery for lung cancer, independent of the effect on early postoperative mortality.
{METHODS}: We studied a population-based cohort of patients with lung cancer who underwent curative-intent surgery in the province of Quebec, Canada, from 2000 to 2005. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare unadjusted overall survival ({OS}) beyond postoperative day 90 for patients with and without complications. Cox regression was used to determine the prognostic impact of 30-day postoperative complications on the {OS} after adjusting for several confounders.
{RESULTS}: The overall 30-day postoperative complication rate was 58.2\% among 4033 eligible patients. A major infectious complication (pneumonia, empyema, or mediastinitis) occurred in 378 patients. The 5-year {OS} was lower for those with any postoperative complication (62.8\%) than those without (73.8\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Those with major infectious complications had the lowest {OS} (56.3\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Postoperative complication was an independent prognostic factor after adjusting for several patient and treatment factors (hazard ratio = 1.37; 95\% confidence interval, 1.21-1.54). Adjusted hazard ratio for major infectious complications was 1.67 (95\% confidence interval, 1.39-2.01).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Postoperative complications, particularly of a major infectious type, are strong negative predictors of long-term survival in lung cancer patients. The strong association between major infectious complications and survival may also open the door to investigational therapies targeting bacterial antigens in the perioperative period in patients who undergo lung cancer surgery.},

Hepatic and renal function, biliary tree pressure and {ANP} plasma concentrations were investigated in conscious rabbits 4 and 24 h after common bile duct ligation, biliovenous shunting or external drainage via a biliary fistula. {RESULTS}: Bilirubin concentration increased after bile duct ligation and creation of a biliovenous shunt. Plasma creatinine increased abruptly in rabbits with a biliovenous shunt. At 4 h, the {ANP} increase in animals with a biliovenous shunt was ninefold that observed after bile duct obstruction while no change was noted after external biliary diversion (mean 350 versus 45 versus 9 fmol/l; P {\textless} 0.01). Relief of biliary tree obstruction was associated with a return of {ANP} levels towards basal normal values. {CONCLUSION}: Raised plasma {ANP} in obstructive jaundice is not the result of an increased biliary pressure per se or absence of bile in the proximal duodenum but of the passage of bile components to the circulation.},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer ({CRC}) is common among older adults and surgical resection with curative intent is the primary treatment of {CRC}. Despite the changing demographics of {CRC} patients and increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities, surgery is increasingly performed in this complex aging population. Clinically important short-term outcomes have improved for this population, but little is known about long-term outcomes. We review the literature to evaluate trends in {CRC} surgery in the geriatric population and the outcomes of surgical treatment. We explore the specific gaps in understanding longitudinal patient-centered outcomes of {CRC} treatment. We then propose adaptations from the geriatrics literature to better predict both short and long-term outcomes after {CRC} surgery. Interventions, such as prehabilitation, coupled with comprehensive geriatric assessment may be important future strategies for identifying vulnerable older patients, ameliorating the modifiable causes of vulnerability, and improving patient-centered longitudinal outcomes. Further research is needed to determine relevant aspects of geriatric assessments, identify effective intervention strategies, and demonstrate their validity in improving outcomes for at-risk older adults.},

{RESULTS}: All bile cultures collected intraoperatively were positive in the {ERBD} group, and the positive rates of drainage fluid cultures on postoperative days 1, 3, and 5 and the incidence of postoperative abdominal abscess formation were significantly higher than those in the {ENBD} group. Moreover, {ERBD} was identified as an independent predictive factor for postoperative pancreatic fistula ({POPF}) formation (hazards ratio, 11.81; P {\textless} 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the preoperative drainage period in the {ERBD} group revealed that the determined cutoff level for the onset of {POPF} was 29 days.

	doi = {10.1038/sj.ijo.0801241},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The objective of this study was to examine the influence of body weight and body composition on aspects of aerobic fitness. Our hypothesis was that increased body weight, specifically increased fat mass ({FM}), would not limit {VO}2max relative to fat-free mass ({FFM}), but would reduce maximal and sub-maximal {VO}2max relative to body weight. {DESIGN}: We used data from two ongoing studies. In Study 1 a cross-sectional analysis of 129 children across a wide spectrum of body composition was performed. In Study 2 we examined data from 31 overweight women before and after weight loss. {METHODS}: {VO}2max was measured using a treadmill test. Sub-maximal aerobic capacity was evaluated with respiratory exchange ratio ({RER}), heart-rate ({HR}), and oxygen uptake relative to {VO}2max at a given workload (\%{VO}2max). Body composition was assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ({DXA}) (Study 1) and a four-compartment model (Study 2). {RESULTS}: In Study 1, {FFM} was the strongest determinant of {VO}2max (r = 0.87; P {\textless} 0.0001). After adjusting for {FFM}, there was no significant influence of {FM} on {VO}2max. After separating children into lean and obese sub-groups, absolute {VO}2max was significantly higher in the obese (1.24+/-0.27 vs 1.56+/-0.40) and {VO}2max relative to body weight was significantly lower (44.2+/-3.2 vs 32.0+/-4.1 ml/(kg-min)), whereas there was no significant difference when expressed relative to {FFM} (57.9+/-5.8 vs 59.2+/-4.9 ml/({kgFFM}-min)). Sub-maximal aerobic capacity was significantly lower in the obese children, as indicated by a higher {HR} and \%{VO}2max; time to exhaustion was significantly lower in the obese children (15.3+/-2.9 vs 11.1+/-2.1 min). In Study 2, {FFM} was also the strongest determinant of {VO}2max before and after weight loss. The relationship between {VO}2max and {FFM} was identical before and after weight loss so that {VO}2max relative to {FFM} was identical before and after weight loss (43.8+/-4.9 vs 45.5+/-6.4 ml/({kgFFM}-min)). However, sub-maximal aerobic capacity was lower in the obese state, as indicated by a significantly higher {RER} (0.85+/-0.06 vs 0.79+/-0.05), {HR} (124+/-14 vs 102+/-11 bpm), and \%{VO}2max (44\% vs 36\%). {CONCLUSION}: The major influence of body weight on {VO}2max is explained by {FFM}; {FM} does not have any effect on {VO}2max. Fatness and excess body weight do not necessarily imply a reduced ability to maximally consume oxygen, but excess fatness does have a detrimental effect on submaximal aerobic capacity. Thus, fatness and {VO}2max should be considered independent entities.},

Measurement of anthropometry, acute phase proteins, interleukin-6, leptin (total and free) and adiponectin were carried out on healthy subjects (n = 13) and non-small cell lung cancer patients with weight loss (n = 20). The groups were age and sex matched. Compared with the controls the cancer group had a lower {BMI} (p {\textless} 0.01), mid-upper arm circumference (p {\textless} 0.001), triceps skinfold thickness (p {\textless} 0.05) and circulating concentrations of albumin (p {\textless} 0.001), haemoglobin (p {\textless} 0.05), free and total leptin (p {\textless} 0.05) and adiponectin (p {\textless} 0.01). In contrast, the cancer group had elevated circulating concentrations of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein concentrations (p {\textless} 0.001). In the cancer group circulating adiponectin concentrations were significantly inversely correlated with both free (rs = -0.675, p = 0.001) and total leptin concentrations (rs = -0.690, p = 0.001). However, neither weight loss, interleukin-6 or C-reactive protein concentrations were correlated with either adiponectin, free or total leptin concentrations in the cancer group. These results suggest that adipokine production is normal and is unlikely to play a major role in the abnormal fat metabolism in weight-losing cancer patients.},

The {LDH} activity in the culture medium was an index of cytolysis and the {MTT} assay was used as an index of mitochondrial impairment. The ratios producing half-maximum cell lysis after 24, 48, and 72 h, were 1.1, 0.9 and 0.85, for astrocytes, and 1.2, 0.75 and 0.75, for fibroblasts. Mitochondrial activity decreased after 24 h for ratio = 0.7 and partly recovered at 48 h. Mitochondrial activity was more impaired in fibroblasts than in astrocytes above ratio = 0.7. The cytotoxic effects were linked to the free bilirubin concentration. We conclude that astrocytes are less sensitive to bilirubin cytotoxic effects than are fibroblasts.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Low cardiopulmonary fitness, measured by oxygen uptake peak ({VO}2pk), is associated with postoperative complications and mortality. Obese people have difficulty in performing the cardiopulmonary exercise test, which requires maximal exertion. The incremental shuttle walking test ({ISWT}) and 6-min walking test (6MWT) have been used to assess cardiorespiratory capacity, mortality, and complications in the postoperative phase. However, the physiological response elicited by these tests in obese people is unknown. This study analyzed and compared cardiopulmonary fitness (oxygen uptake [{VO}2] and {CO}2 output [{VCO}2]) in the {ISWT} and 6MWT in obese adults using a telemetry system.
{METHODS}: Fifteen obese patients (10 women; mean age 39.4 ± 10.1 years; mean body mass index 43.5 ± 6.8 kg/m(2)) with normal forced vital capacity (\% {FVC} 93.7) performed the 6MWT and {ISWT} in the field in this cross-sectional study. Metabolic ({VO}2pk, {VCO}2) and respiratory (minute ventilation; {VE}) variables were recorded using telemetry.
{RESULTS}: Obese patients performed the {ISWT} with an incremental and exponential cardiopulmonary response, with higher {VO}2pk (15.4 ± 2.9 ml/kg/min), {VCO}2 (1.7 ± 0.7 l/min), and {VE} (51.4 ± 21.3 l/min) than the 6MWT ({VO}2pk = 13.2 ± 2.59 ml/kg/min, {VCO}2 = 1.4 ± 0.6 l/min; {VE} = 41.2 ± 16.6 l/min (all p {\textless} 0.01). They also demonstrated more effort intensity, assessed by {VO}2, (p = 0.006) and heart rate (p = 0.04) in the {ISWT} than the 6MWT. In the 6MWT, patients showed a fast rise in ventilatory and metabolic response, reaching a plateau.
{CONCLUSION}: The {ISWT} test generated superior metabolic and ventilatory stress than the 6MWT and may be more suitable for assessing cardiopulmonary fitness than self-paced tests.},

We have recently reported on the safety of using irreversible electroporation ({IRE}) for the management of {LAC}. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the overall survival in patients with {LAC} treated with {IRE}.
{METHODS}: A prospective, multi-institutional evaluation of 54 patients who underwent {IRE} for unresectable pancreatic cancer from December 2009 to October 2010 was evaluated for overall survival and propensity matched to 85 matched stage {III} patients treated with standard therapy defined as chemotherapy and radiation therapy alone.
{RESULTS}: A total of 54 {LAC} patients have undergone {IRE} successfully, with 21 women, 23 men (median age, 61 (range, 45-80) years). Thirty-five patients had pancreatic head primary and 19 had body tumors; 19 patients underwent margin accentuation with {IRE} and 35 underwent in situ {IRE}. Forty-nine (90 \%) patients had pre-{IRE} chemotherapy alone or chemoradiation therapy for a median duration 5 months. Forty (73\%) patients underwent post-{IRE} chemotherapy or chemoradiation. The 90 day mortality in the {IRE} patients was 1 (2 \%). In a comparison of {IRE} patients to standard therapy, we have seen an improvement in local progression-free survival (14 vs. 6 months, p = 0.01), distant progression-free survival (15 vs. 9 months, p = 0.02), and overall survival (20 vs. 13 months, p = 0.03).
{CONCLUSIONS}: {IRE} ablation of locally advanced pancreatic tumors remains safe and in the appropriate patient who has undergone standard induction therapy for a minimum of 4 months can achieve greater local palliation and potential improved overall survival compared with standard chemoradiation-chemotherapy treatments. Validation of these early results will need to be validated in the current multi-institutional Phase 2 {IDE} study.},

	abstract = {Abstract {OBJECTIVE}: To examine clinical outcome in a consecutive cohort of patients undergoing open necrosectomy for postinflammatory necrosis. {BACKGROUND} {INFORMATION}: The last decade has witnessed major developments in the surgical management of pancreatic necrosis. Minimally invasive approaches have become established. However, there are limited data from contemporary open necrosectomy, in particular where multidisciplinary care and aggressive interventional radiology are used. This report provides data on outcome from open necrosectomy in a tertiary referral Hepatobiliary unit over the last decade. {METHODS}: During the period January 1, 2000 to July 31, 2008, 1535 patients were admitted with a final discharge code of acute pancreatitis. Twenty-eight (1.8\%) of all admissions underwent open surgical necrosectomy. Twenty-four (86\%) were tertiary referral patients. {RESULTS}: The median {APACHE} {II} score on admission was 10.5 (5-26). Median logistic organ dysfunction score on admission was 3 (0-10). Median {LODS} score after surgery was 2 (0-8). Twenty patients (71\%) underwent radiologically guided drainage of collections before surgery. Thirty-day mortality occurred in 2 (7\%), 4 further deaths occurred in patients after discharge from intensive care resulting in a total of 6 (22\%) episode-related deaths. {CONCLUSIONS}: Modern open necrosectomy can be performed without the procedure-related deterioration in organ dysfunction associated with major debridement. Multidisciplinary care with an emphasis on aggressive radiologic intervention before and after surgery results in acceptable outcomes in this cohort of critically ill patients. Newer laparoscopic techniques must demonstrate similar outcomes in the setting of stage-matched severity before wider acceptance.},

	abstract = {Although there is increasing appreciation of the role of the host inflammatory response in determining outcome in patients in colorectal cancer, there has been  little concerted effort to favourably manipulate cancer-associated inflammation,  either alone or in combination with current oncological treatment. Epidemiological and cardiovascular disease studies have identified aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and statins as potential chemotherapeutic agents which may manipulate the host inflammatory response to the benefit of the  patient with cancer. Similarly, evidence of a chemotherapeutic effect of histamine-2 receptor antagonists, again mediated by an immunomodulatory effect, has previously led to increased interest in their use in gastrointestinal cancer. Extensive pre-clinical data and a limited number of clinical investigations have  proposed a direct effect of these agents on tumour biology, with an anti-tumour effect on several of the hallmarks of cancer, including proliferative capacity, evasion from apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, and invasive capability of tumour cells. Furthermore, clinical evidence has suggested a pertinent role in down-regulating the systemic inflammatory response whilst favourably influencing  the local inflammatory response within the tumour microenvironment. Despite such  compelling results, the clinical applicability of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs, statins and histamine-2 receptor antagonists has not been fully realised,  particularly in patients identified at high risk on the basis of inflammatory parameters. In the present review, we examine the potential role that these agents may play in improving survival and reducing recurrence in patients with potentially curative colorectal cancer, and in particular focus on their effects  on the local and systemic inflammatory response.},

In the first part of the study, we compared circulating concentrations of free and total leptin, percent fat mass, and the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein ({CRP}) and interleukin-6 ({IL}-6), together  with appetite score, in age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 11) and advanced gastrointestinal cancer patients (n = 26). In the second part of the study, the same measurements were repeated before and after megestrol acetate treatment of weight-losing gastrointestinal cancer patients (n = 10).

Increased waist to hip ratio was associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer in women (adjusted {OR} for the highest vs lowest quartile, 1.87; 95\% {CI}, 1.31-2.69; P(trend) = .003) but less so in men.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These findings provide strong support for a positive association between {BMI} and pancreatic cancer risk. In addition, centralized fat distribution may increase pancreatic cancer risk, especially in women.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The role of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy ({CRT}) in pancreatic cancer remains controversial. The primary aim of this study was to determine if {CRT} improved survival in patients with resected pancreatic cancer in a large, multiinstitutional cohort of patients.
{STUDY} {DESIGN}: Patients undergoing resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma from seven academic medical institutions were included. Exclusion criteria included patients with T4 or M1 disease, R2 resection margin, preoperative therapy, chemotherapy alone, or if adjuvant therapy status was unknown.
{RESULTS}: There were 747 patients included in the initial evaluation. Primary analysis was performed between patients that had surgery alone (n=374) and those receiving adjuvant {CRT} (n=299). Median followup time was 12.2 months and 14.5 months for survivors. Median overall survival for patients receiving adjuvant {CRT} was significantly longer than for those undergoing operation alone (20.0 months versus 14.5 months, p=0.001). On subset and multivariate analysis, adjuvant {CRT} demonstrated a significant survival advantage only among patients who had lymph node ({LN})-positive disease (hazard ratio 0.477, 95\% {CI} 0.357 to 0.638) and not for {LN}-negative patients (hazard ratio 0.810, 95\% {CI} 0.556 to 1.181). Disease-free survival in patients with {LN}-negative disease who received adjuvant {CRT} was significantly worse than in patients who had surgery alone (14.5 months versus 18.6 months, p=0.034).
{CONCLUSIONS}: This large multiinstitutional study emphasizes the importance of analyzing subsets of patients with pancreas adenocarcinoma who have {LN} metastasis. Benefit of adjuvant {CRT} is seen only in patients with {LN}-positive disease, regardless of resection margin status. {CRT} in patients with {LN}-negative disease may contribute to reduced disease-free survival.},

Following a propanil dose of 100 mg/kg, methemoglobin formation attained a maximum level of 5\% by 1.5 hr and declined to  normal levels (approximately 2.5\%) by 12 hr. Hemoglobin binding attained a maximum level of 50 pmol/mg protein by 12 hr, and remained constant for 24 hr. Following a propanil dose of 300 mg/kg, methemoglobin formation attained a maximum level of 24\% by 4.5 hr, and declined to a level of 5\% by 24 hr. Hemoglobin binding attained a maximum level of 425 pmol/mg protein by 12 hr, and  remained constant for 24 hr. Hemoglobin binding was also detected at the lowest propanil dose (10 pmol/mg protein) even though methemoglobin formation was not observed. {HPLC} analysis of alkaline-treated hemoglobin from propanil-treated rats indicated the presence of one radiolabeled compound with the same {HPLC} retention  time as 3,4-dichloraniline. These data are consistent with the concept that propanil is converted to N-hydroxy-3,4-dichloroaniline in the liver. Subsequently, this metabolite enters the erythrocyte and is oxidized by hemoglobin to 3,4-dichloronitrosobenzene with concomitant conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin. The 3,4-dichloronitrosobenzene binds to cysteine  residues on hemoglobin as the corresponding sulfinic acid amide adduct. These data suggest that human exposure to propanil may be monitored in the absence of observable toxicity by the analysis of propanil metabolites bound to hemoglobin.},

The aim of this paper was to compare the current role of {PD} with that of our earlier experience. The records of patients undergoing {PD} at our institution between 1983 and 1996 (Group A) were reviewed and compared with cases between 1956 and 1982 (Group B). Student's t test was used to analyze differences between groups. A total of 153 {PDs} were performed with 98 (64\%) in Group A (88\% of these in the last 6 years) and 55 (36\%) in Group B. Carcinoma of the head of the pancreas was the most common indication for surgery in both periods (43\% and 47\% for Groups A and B, respectively). In Group A, the next most common indication was chronic pancreatitis, accounting for 28 per cent versus 13 per cent in Group B. Carcinoma of ampulla of Vater was also a common indication, making up 21 per cent of the cases in Group A and 20 per cent in Group B. Preoperative biliary drainage was performed in 62 per cent of Group A and 3 per cent of Group B patients (P {\textless} 0.001). Postoperative complications were comparable in both groups: delayed gastric emptying (22\%), wound infection (17\%), pancreatic fistula (13\%), gastrointestinal bleeding (8\%), and intestinal obstruction (3\%). The perioperative mortality rate was significantly different between the two groups: 1 per cent in Group A versus 16 per cent in Group B (P {\textless} 0.001). Mean postoperative length of stay was 17 days in Group A (22 days for benign disease) and 25 days for Group B (P {\textless} 0.01). In the last 40 years, there has been a rise in the use of {PD} for chronic pancreatitis and a significant decrease in postoperative mortality and hospital length of stay.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}.

Understanding the ways in which socioeconomic status ({SES}) affects mortality is important for defining strategies to eliminate the unequal burden of cancer by race and ethnicity in the United States.


{METHODS}.

Disease stage, treatment, and 5-year mortality rates were ascertained by reviewing medical records, and {SES} was determined by analyzing income and education at the census tract level for 4844 women with breast cancer, 4332 men with prostate cancer, and 4422 men and women with colorectal cancer who were diagnosed in 7 U.S. states in 1997.


{RESULTS}.

Low {SES} was associated with more advanced disease stage and with less aggressive treatment for all 3 cancers. The hazard ratio ({HR}) for 5-year all-cause mortality associated with low {SES} was elevated after a diagnosis of breast cancer when the analysis was adjusted for age ({HR}, 1.59; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.35-1.87). Adjustment for mediating factors of race/ethnicity, comorbid conditions, cancer stage, and treatment reduced the association. The age-adjusted mortality risk associated with low {SES} was elevated after a diagnosis of prostate cancer ({HR}, 1.33; 95\% {CI}, 1.13-1.57), and multivariate adjustments for mediating factors also reduced that association. There was less association between {SES} and mortality after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. For all 3 cancer sites, low {SES} was a much stronger predictor of mortality among individuals aged {\textless}65 years and among individuals from racial/ethnic minority groups.


{CONCLUSIONS}.

The current results indicated that low {SES} is a risk factor for all-cause mortality after a diagnosis of cancer, largely because of a later stage at diagnosis and less aggressive treatment. These findings support the need to focus on {SES} as an underlying factor in cancer disparities by race and ethnicity. Cancer 2008. © 2008 American Cancer Society.},

Complications were retrospectively classified by Clavien-Dindo grade. {RESULTS}: Of the 241 patients, the majority were male (59 \%) and were over 65 years old (69 \%). The majority had colonic (86 \%) and node negative (65 \%) disease. One hundred nineteen patients (49 \%) developed a complication, and 28 (12 \%) of these were Clavien-Dindo grade 3, 4 or 5.

This study reexamined the frequency of delayed recovery and assessed other factors associated with adjuvant therapy administration after {PD} at a high-volume center.
{STUDY} {DESIGN}: Preoperative and perioperative variables were reviewed in a consecutive series of 85 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma undergoing {PD} without preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy from 1990 to 2004.
{RESULTS}: Study groups included patients undergoing emergency {PD} (group 1, n=13); elective {PD} with good preoperative Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ({ECOG}) performance status ({PS}) (group 2, {ECOG} {PS}: 0 to 1, n=63); and elective {PD} with marginal preoperative {PS} (group 3, {ECOG} {PS}: 2 to 3, n=9).

The median overall survival rate was found as 9.4 (95 \% {CI}: 6.7-12.1) months in the patients whose {CCI} score was ≤ 2 and was found as 6.2 (95 \% {CI}: 4.0-8.3) months in the patients with {CCI} scores ≥ 3 (p = 0.05). The median overall survival rate was calculated as 9.8 (95 \% {CI}: 6.3-13.4) months in the patients with {CIRS} scores ≤ 2 and was calculated as 8.3 (95 \% {CI}: 6.0-10.6) months in the patients with {CIRS} scores ≥ 3 (p = 0.51). When surgery, radiotherapy, grading, and {CCI} score were evaluated using multivariate analysis, it was observed that only the treatment modality had a significant effect on the survival rate.
{CONCLUSION}: The results on the use of comorbidity indices are contradictory for the cancers with lower survival rates such as pancreatic cancer. New prognostic scales might be developed for this patient group by considering the side effects of chemotherapy.},

	abstract = {Introduction Rehabilitation exercise programs improve recovery from surgery and quality of life. Prehabilitation improves fitness prior to surgery. This is challenging before liver resection as patients tend to be sedentary and time is limited. Our aim was to design a 4 week program, suitable for sedentary individuals, which would yield a 1.5 ml/kg/min increase (10\%) in the relative {VO}2 uptake at the anaerobic threshold ({AT}), as measured by a cardiopulmonary exercise test ({CPET}).
Methods Interval based exercise program of 12 sessions on a stationary bike. Each session 40 min long consisting of six intervals, warm up and cool down. The interval intensities were calculated using anaerobic threshold detected by initial {CPET}. {AT} is independent of volition and can be detected with reliability in most patients. This represents a measure for designing exercise programs for patients. Eleven healthy volunteers completed the exercise program.
Results The 11 volunteers had a mean age of 46 years (range 38–60). They consisted of two men nine women. Mean {BMI} 30.7 (range 25.5–39.2), two smokers, nine non-smokers, no significant comorbidities. 96\% attendance with 9/11 volunteers achieving 100\% attendance. Mean relative {VO}2 at {AT} was 12.4 ml/kg/min pre exercise program and 14.0 ml/kg/min post exercise program, a 12\% improvement (p{\textless}0.001). Mean resting O2 uptake decreased by 28\% (p-0.014). There was a trend to lower resting O2 pulse rate. At {AT} significant differences were achieved in mean O2 pulse (+11.6\%), and power (25.7\%) p{\textless}0.001. Peak values also improved with mean peak O2 pulse climbing by 10.7\% (p-0.001), and mean peak power by 14.7\% (p-0.006).
Conclusion This is the first 4 week exercise program designed for patients prior to liver resection and the only 4 week exercise program based round {AT}. It is feasible in sedentary healthy volunteers and achieves a {\textgreater}10\% fitness improvement. An {RCT} is underway assessing this program's feasibility in patients prior to liver resection. Using our {CPET} risk stratification protocol a 10\% fitness improvement in these patients would move 30\% of our patients from high to low operative risk.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Body mass index ({BMI}), a common surrogate marker for grading obesity, does not differentiate between metabolically active visceral fat and the relatively inert subcutaneous fat. We aim to determine the utility of {BMI} as a prognostic marker for the impact of obesity on outcomes and survival following pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
{METHODS}: From a database of over 1,000 patients who had undergone pancreatoduodenectomy, 228 patients with a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma were identified. Demographic data including {BMI} and perioperative parameters-operative time, estimated blood loss, length of stay, survival, nodal status, and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage-were obtained. Data are presented as median.
{RESULTS}: One hundred ninety-two patients had a {BMI} less than or equal to 29 and 36 patients had a {BMI} greater than or equal to 30 (24 vs. 34, P {\textless} .001). Median age was 70 and the majority of the patients (52\%) were male and the 2 groups of patients did not differ in this regard. A significantly greater number of obese patients had positive nodes (69\% vs. 62\%, P {\textless} .05) and this was associated with a worse survival (14 vs. 18 months, P {\textless} .05).
{CONCLUSIONS}: For patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy, obesity does not impact operative complexity or length of stay but results in a shortened survival. Therefore, we conclude that {BMI} is an important prognostic marker that portends an abbreviated survival following pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}/{PURPOSE}: Hepatobiliary resection ({HBR}) for hilar cholangiocarcinoma ({HCCa}) remains a technically demanding procedure and is still associated with significant rates of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to characterize changes in surgical outcomes following major {HBR} for {HCCa} at a single center over a 25-year period. {METHODS}: Between 1980 and 2004, 126 patients undergoing preoperative biliary drainage, portal vein embolization, and major {HBR} were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the chronological treatment period; i.e., patients who underwent surgery during the initial 20-year period (1980-1999; early group [{EG}]) and those who underwent surgery during the most recent 5-year period (2000-2004; late group [{LG}]). Clinicopathological variables were compared retrospectively between the two groups. {RESULTS}: The mortality rate improved from 7.9\% in the {EG} to 0\% in the {LG}, but this difference did not reach the level of statistical significance (P = 0.058). The overall survival rate at 1, 3, and 5 years was 82.4\%, 43.9\%, and 35.2\%, respectively. The overall survival rate was similar in the two groups (P = 0.153). Morbidity was documented in 57.1\% of all the patients, and was comparable in the two groups (P = 0.471), but the rate of major morbidity was significantly higher in the {EG} (P = 0.031). Red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusion requirements were significantly reduced in the {LG}, both in regard to the number of patients and the amount of blood product administered. The mean length of postoperative hospital stay was significantly reduced, from 74.4 + -56.3 days in the {EG} to 29.0 + -11.8 days in the {LG} (P {\textless} 0.001). Sixty-nine patients (54.8\%) had stage {III} or {IV} disease (according to the General rules for surgical and pathological studies on cancer of the biliary tract of the Japanese Society of Biliary Surgery), and 55 patients (43.7\%) showed positive surgical margins. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of surgical margins or pathological staging. {CONCLUSIONS}: Improvements were documented in rates of major morbidity, length of hospital stay, and the mortality rate in the {LG} when compared with the {EG}. The overall survival rate was similar in the two groups. Blood transfusion requirements were significantly reduced in the {LG} when compared with the {EG}.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: We sought to characterize the effect of postoperative complications on long-term survival after colorectal cancer ({CRC}) resection.
{BACKGROUND}: The impact of early morbidity on long-term survival after curative-intent {CRC} surgery remains controversial.
{METHODS}: The Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program and Central Cancer Registry databases were linked to acquire perioperative and cancer-specific data for 12,075 patients undergoing resection for nonmetastatic {CRC} (1999-2009). Patients were categorized by presence of any complication within 30 days and by type of complication (noninfectious vs infectious). Univariate and multivariate survival analyses adjusted for patient, disease, and treatment factors were performed, excluding early deaths ({\textless}90 days). Subset analysis was performed to determine the specific impact of severe postoperative infections.
{RESULTS}: The overall morbidity and infectious complication rates were 27.8\% and 22.5\%, respectively. Patients with noninfectious postoperative complications were older, had lower preoperative serum albumin, had worse functional status, and had higher American Society of Anesthesiologists scores than patients with infectious complications and without complications (all P {\textless} 0.001). The presence of any complication was independently associated with decreased long-term survival [hazard ratio, 1.24; 95\% confidence interval (1.15-1.34)]. Multivariate analysis by complication type demonstrated increased risk only with infectious complications [hazard ratio, 1.31; 95\% confidence interval (1.21-1.42)]. Subset analysis demonstrated this effect predominantly in patients with severe infections [hazard ratio, 1.41; 95\% confidence interval (1.15-1.73)].
{CONCLUSIONS}: The presence of postoperative complications after {CRC} resection is associated with decreased long-term survival, independent of patient, disease, and treatment factors. The impact on long-term outcome is primarily driven by infectious complications, particularly severe postoperative infections.},

The multiple-gated blood pool cardioscintigraphic studies were done in 9 jaundiced patients who had either cholestatic or obstructive jaundice (mean total bilirubin 29.30 +/- 3.30 mg/{dL}), and in 8 normal volunteers (total bilirubin less than 1 mg\%). None of the patients had evidences of obvious cirrhosis, intrinisic heart disease, or septicemia. Following intravenous dobutamine there was comparable change of blood pressure and heart rate in both groups. However the response of left ventricular ejection fraction ({LVEF}) to dobutamine (10 micrograms/kg/min x 5 min) was strikingly blunted in the jaundiced patients as compared to that seen in the normal controls (3.56 +/- 0.9 vs. 12.7 +/- 2.2\%, p less than 0.005).

	abstract = {Introduction Pancreatic resection is being performed with increasing frequency and safety. Technical outcomes and long-term survival for neoplastic lesions are well reported; however, reasons why patients do not undergo surgery for potentially resectable lesions are not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the factors contributing to the decision not to operate for resectable pancreatic neoplasms. Methods From 2004 to 2008, all patients with resectable pancreatic neoplasms at a single high-volume hepatopancreaticobiliary center were evaluated. The impact of patient factors, sociodemographics, medical comorbidities (Charlson combined comorbidity index ({CCI}) and {ACCI}), disease factors (tumor characteristics), and surgical factors (type of resection required) on the decision to undergo pancreatectomy were analyzed using univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis. Results Three hundred seventy-five patients with resectable pancreatic lesions were identified. The median age was 62 years (21–93); 203 out of 375 (54.1\%) were males. Fifty-five (14.7\%) did not undergo resection. On univariate analysis, age (odds ratio ({OR}) 1.116, p {\textless} 0.001), non-English speaking background ({NESB}; {OR} 4.276, p = 0.001), tumor type (p = 0.001 increased for cystic neoplasms including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm), {CCI} score ({OR} 1.239, p = 0.001), and {ACCI} score ({OR} 1.433, p {\textless} 0.001) were associated with an increased risk of not undergoing resection. Gender, age, marital status, and urban residence were not predictive. On multivariate analysis, {NESB} (p = 0.018) and the {ACCI} (p = 0.002) remained predictive of not undergoing resection. The majority of patients did not undergo surgery because the patient declined in 25 out of 55 (45.5\%), and resection was not offered in 15 out of 55 (27.3\%). In the remainder, medical contraindications precluded surgery. Advanced age, tumor type, comorbidities (27.3\%), age (21.8\%), surgical risk (29.1\%), frailty (18.2\%), and uncertain diagnosis (5.5\%) were cited as reasons for not proceeding with surgery. Conclusion Patients with a higher {ACCI} and those from a {NESB} are less likely to undergo surgery for resectable neoplastic lesions of the pancreas. These factors must be taken into consideration in the decision-making process when considering surgery for patients with pancreatic neoplasms. Novel strategies should be employed to optimize access to surgery for patients with resectable pancreatic neoplasms.},

	abstract = {To determine whether hemorrhage without major tissue trauma can itself produce immunosuppression, the effect of hemorrhage on the lymphocyte response to T-cell mitogen in endotoxin-resistant C3H/{HEJ} mice was measured. The mice were bled to achieve a mean blood pressure of 35 mm Hg, maintained at that level for one hour, and then adequately resuscitated. On days 1 through 10 thereafter, the proliferative responses of the splenocytes to concanavalin A were measured and allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction was performed. The proliferative responses to mitogen stimulation as well as the results of mixed lymphocyte reaction studies indicated that marked immunosuppression occurred at day 1. Immunosuppression persisted for at least five days following hemorrhage, as evidenced by mitogen stimulation assay. Another group of mice was subjected to sepsis three days after hemorrhage and resuscitation. The mortalities in the sham-hemorrhage and hemorrhage groups following sepsis were 58\% and 100\%, respectively. Thus, a significant depression of cellular immunity occurred following simple hemorrhage despite adequate resuscitation, and this immunosuppression enhanced the susceptibility to sepsis.},

	volume = {29},
	url = {http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18164405},
	abstract = {It is well established that high levels of unconjugated bilirubin ({UCB}) can be toxic to the central nervous system, and oxidative stress is emerging as a relevant event in the mechanisms of {UCB} encephalopathy. In contrast, the hydrophilic bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid ({UDCA}), has been reported as a cytoprotective and antioxidant molecule. In this study, we investigated if exposure of rat neurons in primary culture to clinically relevant concentrations of {UCB} leads to oxidative injury. The contribution of oxidative stress in {UCB} neurotoxicity was further investigated by examining whether the reduction of {NO} production by {NAME}, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, prevents the disruption of the redox status and neuronal damage. Moreover, we evaluated the ability of glycoursodeoxycholic acid ({GUDCA}), the most relevant conjugated derivative in the serum of patients treated with {UDCA}, to abrogate the {UCB}-induced oxidative damage. Cultured rat neurons were incubated with 50 or 100microM {UCB} in the presence of 100microM human serum albumin, alone or in combination with 100microM {NAME} or with 50microM {GUDCA}, for 4h at 37 degrees C. Protein carbonyls, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-protein adducts, intracellular glutathione content and cell death were determined. The results obtained showed that {UCB} induces protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation, while diminishes the thiol antioxidant defences, events that were correlated with the extent of cell death. Moreover, these events were counteracted by {NAME} and abrogated in the presence of {GUDCA}. Collectively, this study shows that oxidative stress is one of the pathways associated with neuronal viability impairment by {UCB}, and that {GUDCA} significantly prevents such effects from occurring. These findings corroborate the antioxidant properties of the bile acid and point to a new therapeutic approach for {UCB}-induced neurotoxicity due to oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: There is increasing evidence that the local and systemic inflammatory responses are associated with survival in oesophageal cancer. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between tumour necrosis, tumour proliferation, local and systemic inflammation and microvessel density and survival in patients undergoing potentially curative resection of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. {METHODS}: The interrelationship between tumour necrosis, tumour proliferation, local inflammatory response (Klintrup-Makinen criteria, intra-tumoural {CD}8+ lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration), systemic inflammatory response (modified Glasgow Prognostic score ({mGPS})), and microvessel density was examined in 121 patients undergoing potentially curative resection for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (including type I and {II} tumours of the gastro-oesophageal junction). {RESULTS}: Tumour necrosis was not significantly associated with any tumour measure other than the degree of differentiation. On multivariate analysis, only age ({HR} 1.93, 95\% {CI} 1.23-3.04, P=0.004), {mGPS} ({HR} 2.91, 95\% {CI} 1.51-5.62, P=0.001), positive to total lymph node ratio ({HR} 2.38, 95\% {CI} 1.60-3.52, P{\textless}0.001) and macrophage infiltration ({HR} 1.49, 95\% {CI} 1.02-2.18, P=0.041) were independently associated with cancer-specific survival in oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Intra-tumoural macrophages were associated with tumour proliferation (P{\textless}0.001) and {CD}8+ lymphocytes infiltration (P{\textless}0.01). {CONCLUSION}: The results of this study suggest that tumour necrosis does not link  local and systemic inflammatory responses and is not significantly associated with survival. In contrast, tumour macrophage infiltration appears to have a central role in the proliferative activity and the coordination of the inflammatory cell infiltrate and is independently associated with poorer survival in patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma.},
